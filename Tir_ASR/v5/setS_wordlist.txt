Ethiopia’s
crisis
:
One
Year
on
BY
:
RENÉ
LEFORT
.
Almost
exactly
a
year
ago
,
Ethiopia
entered
its
worst
crisis
since
the
arrival
of
the
regime
in
1991
.
Last
month
,
a
state
of
emergency
was
proclaimed
.
These
two
events
have
generated
a
flood
of
commentary
and
analysis
.
A
few
key
points
,
sometimes
underplayed
if
not
ignored
,
are
worth
closer
attention
.
“
Mengist
yelem
!”
–
“
Authority
has
disappeared
!”
People
waited
in
vain
for
the
government
to
react
other
than
by
brute
force
alone
to
the
opposition
it
was
facing
and
the
resulting
chaos
.
The
unrest
in
Oromya
,
Ethiopia’s
most
populous
state
with
35
%
of
the
country’s
total
population
,
began
on
November
12
,
2015
;
the
uprising
in
part
of
the
Amhara
Region
,
the
second
largest
by
population
(
27
%),
on
July
12
,
2016
.
For
11
long
months
the
government
was
content
to
quell
protest
and
to
release
information
in
dribs
and
drabs
,
the
epitome
of
one-sided
doublespeak
.
A
handful
of
cryptic
press
releases
repeated
the
same
platitudes
ad
nauseam
.
When
in
June
2016
the
ruling
power
finally
realized
the
severity
of
the
crisis
,
launching
a
series
of
internal
deliberations
,
these
took
place
in
total
secrecy
.
This
pseudo-communication
destroyed
its
credibility
and
in
turn
lent
credence
to
the
sole
alternative
source
of
information
,
the
diaspora
,
which
itself
is
often
hyperbolic
to
the
point
of
implausibility
.
On
both
sides
,
the
space
available
for
information
that
exhibits
even
a
degree
of
measure
,
not
to
say
simple
rationality
,
is
shrinking
alarmingly
.

On
both
sides
,
the
space
available
for
information
that
exhibits
even
a
degree
of
measure
,
not
to
say
simple
rationality
,
is
shrinking
alarmingly
.
People
have
stopped
taking
notice
of
anything
the
ruling
power
says
,
seeing
it
as
incapable
of
handling
the
situation
.
In
short
,
trust
has
gone
.
“
It
is
not
even
able
to
listen
…
It
has
lost
its
collective
ability
to
reach
the
collective
mindset
of
the
governed
”
.
[

The
general
view
is
that
Prime
Minister
Hailemariam
Dessalegn
“
always
promises
but
never
delivers
”.
Both
in
central
government
and
in
the
regional
authorities
,
or
between
one
and
the
other
,
authority
has
dramatically
deflated
.
A
multitude
of
anecdotes
confirm
that
it
is
being
ignored
–
officials
simply
turn
their
backs
–
or
even
mocked
,
right
up
to
the
highest
levels
.
The
man
in
the
street
could
only
conclude
:
“
Mengist
yelem
!”
–
“
Authority
has
disappeared
!”
.
This
perception
,
initially
confined
to
the
cities
,
is
increasingly
reaching
into
the
rural
areas
as
they
open
up
more
and
more
.
An
even
more
serious
indictment
is
spreading
.
The
government’s
primary
role
is
to
maintain
law
and
order
,
and
it
has
proved
incapable
of
doing
so
;
worse
still
,
the
violence
of
repression
is
further
fueling
discontent
.
In
the
end
,
rather
than
fulfilling
its
first
duty
,
the
ruling
power
has
become
the
principal
cause
of
revolt.In

“
Meles
left
with
the
password
”
Why
this
impotence
and
loss
of
credibility
?
Under
Meles
Zenawi
,
the
all-powerful
Prime
Minister
who
died
suddenly
in
August
2012
,
the
system
of
power
was
like
a
pyramid
.
Meles
sat
enthroned
at
the
summit
,
and
below
him
,
every
tier
–
executive
or
legislative
,
political
or
economic
,
national
or
regional
,
even
local
–
was
simply
a
transmission
belt
from
the
top
.
Party
and
State
were
inextricably
intertwined
.
This
profoundly
centralized
and
vertical
system
,
intensifying
over
the
years
,
hung
on
him
alone
.
For
most
observers
,
the
smooth
succession
from
Meles
Zenawi
to
Hailemariam
Desalegn
proved
the
robustness
of
the
regime
and
the
reliability
of
its
institutions
.
However
,
Hailemariam
lacks
what
it
takes
to
“
fill
the
boots
”
of
his
predecessor
.
Most
of
his
authority
comes
not
from
his
own
resources
but
has
been
handed
down
to
him
through
a
constellation
of
powers
–
baronies
one
might
call
them
–
characterized
not
just
by
their
diversity
,
but
also
by
the
rivalry
,
or
even
conflict
,
between
them
.
In
short
,
Ethiopia
is
left
with
a
system
of
power
tailored
for
a
strongman
and
filled
accordingly
,
but
which
now
lacks
a
strongman
.
“
Meles
left
with
the
password
”
,
the
joke
goes
.
The
succession
couldn’t
be
a
change
of
personnel
only
.
The
whole
power
system
too
needed
reshaping
,
and
this
is
in
full
swing
.
Hence
the
misfires
in
response
to
the
crisis
.
People
used
to
say
that
Ethiopia
was
like
a
plane
on
autopilot
,
controlled
by
the
Meles
software
(“
Meles
legacy
”
).
To
pursue
the
metaphor
in
current
circumstances
,
the
more
turbulence
the
plane
encounters
,
the
more
ineffective
the
software
has
proved
to
be
.
It
is
noteworthy
that
constant
references
to
that
legacy
have
practically
disappeared
from
official
rhetoric
.
So
the
software
has
been
disconnected
,
but
no
pilot
–
whether
individual
or
collective
–
has
been
able
to
take
over
the
controls
.
Three
big
sources
of
the
crisis
The
weakening
of
central
authority
–
Addis
Ababa
–
has
thus
released
centrifugal
–
regional
–
forces
that
had
been
steadily
stifled
in
Meles
Zenawi’s
iron
grip
.
The
first
source
of
the
current
crisis
is
the
trial
of
strength
between
central
authority
and
the
peripheral
powers
that
it
originally
created
–
a
sort
of
bid
for
emancipation
from
the
father
–
as
well
as
between
the
peripheral
powers
.
At
stake
is
the
sharing
of
powers
and
resources
,
notably
between
the
regions
and
Addis
Ababa
,
where
Tigrayans
are
perceived
to
be
overrepresented
,
wrongly
in
their
view
,
quite
obviously
according
to
all
the
other
ethnicities
.
In
other
words
,
what
is
at
stake
is
the
place
that
should
be
assigned
to
the
“
people’s
fundamental
freedoms
and
rights
”
enshrined
in
the
constitution
,
collective
rights
.
How
can
the
country
make
the
transition
from
a
bogus
and
ethnically
weighted
federalism
to
real
decentralization
,
which
would
bring
about
a
more
authentic
and
ethnically
fairer
federalism
,
or
even
confederalism
?
The
immemorial
“
national
question
”
remains
as
acute
as
ever
:
what
will
the
name
Ethiopia
come
to
refer
to
?
In
other
words
,
why
should
and
how
can
an
Ethiopian
state
exist
,
and
on
what
basis?What
will
the
name
Ethiopia
come
to
refer
to
?
This
question
has
deep
historical
roots
.
From
the
mid-nineteenth
century
onwards
,
the
economic
centre
of
gravity
shifted
from
the
North
–
Abyssinia
–
towards
the
Centre
.
But
power
always
remained
Abyssinian
.
At
stake
in
the
current
crisis
is
a
historic
break
that
would
also
shift
power
to
the
Centre
,
i.e
.
to
Oromya
.
Despite
their
internal
divisions
,
this
claim
unites
the
vast
majority
of
Oromo
,
justified
by
their
numbers
and
their
major
contribution
to
the
economy
.
It
is
generally
agreed
that
a
genuine
application
of
the
constitution
would
be
sufficient
for
this
claim
to
be
satisfied
.
For
the
Amhara
,
whose
elite
dominated
Abyssinian
power
for
more
than
a
century
,
the
challenge
is
to
revamp
their
identity
.
They
have
to
say
farewell
to
their
historical
ascendancy
and
accept
that
their
place
in
the
Ethiopian
state
should
reflect
their
numerical
and
economic
importance
,
no
more
,
no
less
.
In
other
words
,
the
only
way
out
of
the
undoubted
ostracism
they
suffer
is
not
to
re-establish
the
former
status
quo
.
The
assertion
of
“
Amhara-ness
”
–
legitimate
as
it
is
–
cannot
become
a
cover
for
the
aspiration
for
a
return
to
an
“
Ethiopianness
”
based
around
Amhara
,
with
the
other
ethnicities
in
a
lesser
role
.
This
metamorphosis
is
under
way
,
but
not
yet
complete
.
Nonetheless
,
many
Oromo
and
even
more
Tigrayans
deny
that
anything
has
changed
,
convinced
that
this
elite
has
not
abandoned
its
“
chauvinism
”
and
“
revanchism
”,
and
that
the
federal
system
that
they
defend
tooth
and
nail
could
therefore
never
satisfy
its
deeply
cherished
ambition.The
only
way
out
of
the
undoubted
ostracism
[
the
Amhara
]
suffer
is
not
to
re-establish
the
former
status
quo
.
These
ethno-nationalisms
have
become
inflamed
and
even
paranoid
.
Today
,
“
all
the
politics
is
revolving
around
ethnicity
”,
a
former
senior
TPLF
official
told
me
,
and
in
a
previous
remark
:
“
what
I
see
now
dominantly
…
is
the
proliferation
of
racial
or
ethnic
hatred
”.
[

]
It
is
focused
on
the
Tigrayans
,
not
only
because
of
the
major
role
of
the
Tigrayan
Peoples’s
Liberation
Front
(
TPLF
),
but
because
both
Oromo
and
Amhara
equate
Tigrayan
silence
in
the
face
of
repression
with
approval
.
“
The
preliminary
rhetoric
of
ethnic
cleansing
is
already
here
”,
opines
one
social
scientist
,
a
man
familiar
with
the
grass
roots
of
the
country
.
The
second
source
of
the
crisis
relates
to
what
might
be
called
“
democratic
aspiration
”.
In
this
respect
,
Ethiopia’s
leaders
are
right
to
talk
about
the
price
of
success
.
Economic
growth
has
brought
the
emergence
of
a
new
middle
class
,
not
just
urban
but
also
in
the
countryside
,
which
has
seen
the
rapid
enrichment
of
an
upper
tier
of
farmers
.
In
parallel
,
education
has
dramatically
expanded
.
This
upper
tier
has
opened
up
to
the
outside
world
,
in
particular
through
social
media
.
However
,
the
aspiration
for
“
individual
rights
”
runs
up
against
a
system
of
power
which
,
everywhere
in
Ethiopia
,
from
the
summit
of
the
state
to
the
lowliest
levels
of
authority
,
from
the
capital
to
the
smallest
village
,
shares
the
same
defects
:
authoritarianism
,
stifling
control
,
infantilization
.
Finally
,
the
third
source
of
the
crisis
relates
to
collateral
damage
from
super-rapid
growth
.
Such
damage
is
inevitable
,
but
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
type
and
methods
of
development
pursued
.
First
,
forced
imposition
through
ultra-centralized
and
secretive
decision-making
,
and
brutal
execution
.
“
Land
grabbing
”,
and
more
generally
almost
instant
evictions
with
absurd
levels
of
compensation
,
are
commonplace
.
Second
,
the
overwhelming
role
of
the
ruling
power
through
the
“
developmental
state
”
has
produced
an
ever
more
powerful
and
arrogant
oligarchy
embedded
in
the
Party-State
.
The
stakes
in
the
crisis
are
not
only
political
:
they
directly
concern
the
mobilization
,
distribution
and
therefore
the
accumulation
of
resources
in
the
hands
of
the
ruling
power
,
and
hence
the
division
of
the
cake
between
central
and
peripheral
authorities
and/or
oligarchies
,
but
also
between
these
oligarchies
and
the
population
in
general
.
The
present
crisis
is
particularly
acute
because
these
three
factors
reinforce
each
other
.
The
demonstrators
chant
“
we
want
justice
”
and
“
we
want
freedom
”,
but
also
“
Oromya
is
not
for
sale
”
and
“
we
want
self
rule
”
or
,
in
Gondar
,
the
historic
capital
of
the
Amhara
,
“
respect
for
Amhara-ness
”
.
[

]
“
The
preliminary
rhetoric
of
ethnic
cleansing
is
already
here
.
”
“
Alarmists
”
and
“
complacents
”
In
this
poisonous
climate
,
the
vigour
and
scale
of
the
protest
accentuated
the
“
crisis
of
leadership
”
.
[
5
]
It
was
the
first
factor
responsible
for
the
government’s
paralysis
,
as
confirmed
by
one
participant
in
the
last
meeting
of
the
Central
Committee
of
the
TPLF
,
in
early
October
.
He
ascribes
it
first
of
all
to
pure
and
simple
“
power
struggles
”
,
leading
to
a
tussle
that
is
all
the
more
confused
in
that
these
conflicts
run
through
every
regional
party
,
the
relations
between
those
parties
,
and
between
those
parties
and
the
centre
,
while
on
the
same
time
the
centre
originates
from
the
peripheries
:
the
supreme
decision-making
body
is
the
Executive
Committee
of
the
EPRDF
(
Ethiopian
People’s
Revolutionary
Democratic
Front
),
composed
equally
of
representatives
of
the
TPLF
,
ANDM
(
Amhara
National
Democratic
Movement
),
OPDO
(
Oromo
People’s
Democratic
Organisation
)
and
SPDM
(
Southern
People’s
Democratic
Movement
).
These
conflicts
are
first
of
all
personal
in
nature
,
based
on
local
affinities
,
religious
solidarities
,
family
connections
,
not
to
mention
business
interests
.
However
,
the
crisis
triggered
a
new
and
crucial
division
,
between
“
alarmists
”
and
“
complacents
”,
the
former
advocating
a
rapid
shift
from
the
status
quo
,
the
latter
seeing
neither
its
necessity
nor
its
urgency
.
The
“
old
guard
”
is
the
backbone
of
the
“
alarmists
”.
It
consists
of
the
survivors
of
the
founding
group
of
the
TPLF
,
including
the
heads
of
the
army
and
the
security
services
,
Samora
Yunus
and
Getachew
Assefa
,
plus
some
old
comrades
in
arms
such
as
Berket
Simon
,
guiding
light
of
the
ANDM
.
They
became
involved
in
politics
in
the
early
1970s
,
within
the
student
protest
movement
against
Haile
Selassie
.
Their
long
journey
together
gives
them
an
experience
,
a
maturity
,
and
a
cohesion
greater
than
that
of
any
current
within
the
EPRDF
.
Concentrated
in
the
centre
,
in
Addis
Ababa
,
most
of
them
were
sidelined
from
official
positions
as
Meles
imposed
generational
change
.
Returning
in
force
behind
the
scenes
after
his
death
,
they
are
the
strongest
backers
of
Hailemariam
Dessalegn
They
ascribe
the
crisis
to
the
breaking
of
the
bonds
between
“
the
people
”
and
the
party
.
In
their
view
,
those
most
responsible
are
the
regional
parties
,
starting
with
their
new
leaders
.
The
urgent
priority
is
to
restore
those
bonds
and
to
reinforce
central
power
,
to
compensate
for
the
failures
of
the
regional
authorities.Everywhere
in
Ethiopia
…
shares
the
same
defects
:
authoritarianism
,
stifling
control
,
infantilization
.
Hailemariam
expressed
the
anxiety
of
this
group
when
he
said
that
the
issues
facing
the
regime
are
a
matter
of
“
life
or
death
”,
[
6
]
and
that
Ethiopia
is
“
sliding
towards
ethnic
conflict
similar
to
that
in
neighbouring
countries
”.
[
7
]
Abay
Tsehaye
,
said
to
be
the
most
political
head
of
the
TPLF
,
raised
the
specter
of
a
genocide
even
worse
than
Rwanda’s
.
[
8
]
Bereket
Simon
warned
the
leadership
of
his
party
that
the
country
was
sliding
towards
the
abyss
.
In
vain
.
In
contrast
,
Debretsion
Gebremichael
,
member
of
the
Politburo
of
the
TPLF
and
until
recently
Deputy
Prime
Minister
,
one
of
the
foremost
of
the
second
generation
of
leaders
,
retorted
that
there
had
simply
been
a
few
,
geographically
limited
“
disturbances
”
,
that
they
did
not
reflect
the
overall
situation
in
the
country
,
that
“
there
is
no
mobilization
against
Tigrayans
anywhere
”
.
And
even
,
dogmatically
:
“
It
is
not
possible
to
have
people
to
people
[
i.e
.
ethnic
]
conflict
in
Ethiopia
”.
[

]
The
“
complacents
”
are
usually
described
as
“
technocrats
”
and
“
careerists
”.
They
are
considered
to
be
“
apparatchiks
”,
lacking
any
political
fibre
,
owing
their
position
and
the
privileges
and
advantages
–
often
undeserved
–
that
they
enjoy
,
entirely
to
it
.
They
will
only
be
able
to
conceal
and
perpetuate
those
benefits
as
long
as
the
Party
remains
a
bunker
.
Any
opening
up
,
any
movement
towards
a
little
good
governance
,
transparency
,
and
accountability
,
would
be
the
end
of
them
.
They
are
also
haunted
by
the
implacable
rule
of
“
winner
takes
all
”
that
has
accompanied
every
previous
regime
change
.
However
,
their
attitude
is
ambivalent
.
On
the
one
hand
,
they
are
tooth
and
nail
defenders
of
the
EPRDF’s
monopoly
of
power
,
and
therefore
equally
implicated
in
the
repression.The
‘
complacents
’
will
only
be
able
to
conceal
and
perpetuate
those
benefits
as
long
as
the
Party
remains
a
bunker
.
On
the
other
hand
,
they
ascribe
responsibility
for
the
crisis
to
excessive
central
power
,
claiming
that
it
hinders
regional
authority
.
In
order
to
reverse
this
imbalance
,
and
thereby
strengthen
their
own
positions
,
they
are
taking
advantage
of
the
outbreaks
of
ethno-nationalisms
,
notably
by
attempting
to
exploit
the
corresponding
popular
demands
to
their
own
advantage
,
up
to
and
including
the
serious
slide
into
anti-Tigrayan
sentiment
.
“
The
fate
of
Ethiopia
would
be
determined
by
its
periphery
”
In
Oromya
,
at
least
part
of
the
OPDO
,
right
up
to
leadership
level
,
encouraged
the
opposition
to
the
Addis
Ababa
Master
Plan
,
the
scheme
to
extend
the
capital’s
administrative
scope
into
adjacent
areas
of
Oromya
,
which
triggered
near
universal
unrest
across
the
whole
State
.
The
same
actors
then
did
everything
they
could
to
prevent
Oromya
being
placed
under
military
command
from
Addis
Ababa
and
then
,
having
failed
,
to
put
a
stop
to
it
.
At
least
locally
,
the
authorities
–
necessarily
members
of
OPDO
–
and
the
militias
–
under
their
sole
control
–
went
so
far
as
to
lend
the
protesters
a
hand
.
This
ethno-nationalist
outbreak
contributed
to
the
appointment
of
Lemma
Megersa
and
Workneh
Gebeyehu
to
the
leadership
of
the
OPDO
,
after
the
forced
resignation
of
numbers
one
and
two
Muktar
Kedir
and
Aster
Mamo
,
who
were
seen
as
puppets
of
Addis
Ababa
.
The
new
duo
are
long-time
members
of
the
security
services
,
but
are
said
to
be
protégés
of
Abadula
Gemadah
,
the
OPDO’s
only
strongman
,
hence
formerly
sidelined
by
Meles
Zenawi
.
The
main
thing
is
that
the
OPDO
was
able
to
assert
its
autonomy
by
electing
leaders
without
external
pressure
or
diktat
.
In
the
Amhara
region
,
it
is
equally
unquestionable
that
the
big
initial
demonstrations
,
though
officially
banned
,
were
held
with
the
support
or
tacit
approval
of
part
of
the
ANDM
.
At
least
at
local
level
,
the
authorities
and
the
security
forces
allowed
“
ethnic
cleansing
”
against
Tigrayans
to
take
place
,
prompting
8000
to
flee
to
Tigray
.
[
10
]
Gedu
Andergatchew
,
ANDM
strongman
,
who
is
accused
of
having
at
least
turned
a
blind
eye
,
is
still
in
place
.
Even
in
Tigray
,
the
regional
authorities
–
“
TPLF
Mekele
”
–
are
playing
the
nationalist
card
.
Abay
Woldu
,
President
of
the
region
and
Chairman
of
the
TPLF
,
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
the
integrity
of
Tigray
was
non
negotiable
,
in
a
clear
allusion
to
Tigray’s
retention
of
the
Wolkait
area
,
whose
restoration
is
demanded
by
some
Amhara
,
and
despite
Addis
Ababa’s
call
for
the
Amhara
and
Tigrayan
governments
to
negotiate
this
long
standing
issue
.
This
firmness
played
a
big
part
in
the
shift
in
at
least
part
of
Tigrayan
opinion
,
expressed
with
rare
vehemence
by
some
circles
.
They
vilified
the
“
TPLF
Mekele
”,
despised
for
its
lack
of
education
and
impotence
.
They
placed
all
their
hopes
in
the
Tigrayan
old
guard
,
“
TPLF
Addis
”.
According
to
them
,
only
this
old
guard
could
bring
about
the
democratization
essential
to
the
survival
of
the
regime
and
,
in
the
long
term
,
the
Tigrayan
minority’s
control
over
its
own
affairs
.
The
same
old
guard
,
they
now
complain
,
has
doubly
betrayed
the
Tigrayan
people
:
by
evolving
into
an
oligarchy
that
neglects
the
latter’s
economic
aspirations
;
and
by
turning
its
back
on
their
national
interests
.
On
the
first
point
,
they
rightly
emphasize
that
Tigray
still
lags
behind
in
terms
of
development
.
But
at
the
same
time
Tigrayan
businessmen
are
said
to
earn
exorbitant
profits
from
undeserved
privileges
.
In
fact
,
the
paradox
is
only
apparent
:
there
is
so
little
potential
in
Tigray
that
they
invest
elsewhere
.
Regarding
the
“
national
betrayal
”,
these
critics
highlight
the
old
guard’s
loyalty
to
its
Marxist
past
,
claiming
that
they
remain
“
internationalist
”,
“
cosmopolitan
”,
and
“
universalist
”
out
of
political
ambition
and
material
interest
.
Addis
Ababa
offers
positions
and
advantages
that
Tigray
,
poor
and
small
as
it
is
,
would
be
hard
put
to
provide
.
The
more
the
balance
between
centre
and
periphery
shifts
towards
the
centre
,
the
more
attractive
these
positions
and
advantages
become
.
In
short
,
the
view
is
that
the
old
guard
has
yielded
to
a
centuries-old
tradition
of
Ethiopian
history
:
letting
itself
be
“
assimilated
”
by
the
centre
and
prioritizing
the
latter’s
interests
over
those
of
the
periphery
.
As
the
historian
Haggai
Erlich
has
written
,
“
a
central
position
”
in
Addis
Ababa
has
always
been
preferable
to
remaining
a
“
chief
in
a
remote
province
”.
[
11
]
The
more
the
balance
between
centre
and
periphery
shifts
towards
the
centre
,
the
more
attractive
these
positions
and
advantages
become
.
In
consequence
,
these
Tigrayans
feel
they
have
no
other
choice
than
to
take
charge
of
their
own
destiny
and
count
only
on
themselves
,
i.e
.
something
like
building
a
“
fortress
Tigray
”.
It
is
up
to
the
new
generation
to
take
over
from
the
old
,
which
has
given
up
,
even
if
this
means
embracing
the
“
narrow
nationalism
”
of
which
its
critics
accuse
it
.
This
goes
as
far
as
to
see
a
re-emergence
of
the
hope
of
reunifying
Tigrayans
on
both
sides
of
the
Ethiopia/Eritrea
border
into
a
single
nation
state
.
In
this
view
,
the
other
regions
’
demands
for
self-rule
should
therefore
be
heard
.
Central
government
should
be
content
with
“
regulating
”
,
“
balancing
”
,
“
moderating
”
,
“
arbitrating
”
,
“
coordinating
”
,
etc
.
That
it
should
be
headed
by
an
Oromo
prime
minister
would
be
in
the
natural
order
of
things
,
since
Ormoya
has
the
largest
population
,
and
would
help
to
calm
feelings
in
the
region
.
In
short
,
one
Tigrayan
intellectual
has
joked
,
a
new
Age
of
the
Princes
would
be
established
,
but
one
in
which
the
Princes
did
not
fight
amongst
themselves
,
[
12
]
more
seriously
going
on
to
express
the
wish
that
,
for
the
first
time
in
history
,
“
the
fate
of
Ethiopia
would
be
determined
by
its
periphery
”.
State
of
emergency
The
indignation
aroused
by
the
carnage
in
Bishoftu
during
the
traditional
Oromo
annual
festival
(
October
2
),
[
13
]
the
widespread
destruction
that
followed
the
call
for
“
five
days
of
rage
”
in
response
,
made
the
ruling
power’s
paralysis
even
more
untenable
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
series
of
internal
consultations
within
the
EPRDF
was
coming
to
an
end
.
The
package
of
measures
announced
on
October
9
reflects
the
shakiness
of
the
snatched
compromise
.
However
acute
their
lack
of
mutual
trust
,
the
political
currents
and/or
the
ethnic
components
of
the
EPRDF
had
to
arrive
at
an
agreement
:
they
knew
that
they
had
“
to
work
together
or
else
to
sink
together
”.
The
state
of
emergency
was
proclaimed
in
order
“
to
deal
with
anti-peace
elements
that
…
are
jeopardising
the
peace
and
security
of
the
country
”.
[
14
]
Commentators
see
it
as
evidence
that
the
regime
was
“
overwhelmed
”.
But
it
adds
little
,
whether
to
the
existing
legislative
arsenal
,
[
15
]
or
to
the
operational
capacities
of
the
security
forces
since
,
in
practice
,
they
have
never
seen
themselves
as
severely
restricted
by
the
law
.
The
first
objective
is
to
instil
fear
and
uncertainty
,
especially
as
several
provisions
are
so
vague
that
they
can
be
interpreted
in
almost
any
way
.
They
are
now
in
everyone’s
mind
.
For
example
,
for
the
first
time
,
long-standing
informants
have
cancelled
interviews
because
of
the
potential
risk.The
first
objective
is
to
instil
fear
and
uncertainty
.
The
second
objective
is
to
give
the
military
the
legal
sanction
that
army
chief
Samora
Yunus
was
demanding
as
a
condition
of
continuing
to
maintain
internal
order
.
However
,
this
proclamation
also
demonstrates
that
the
centre
has
won
a
round
in
its
trial
of
strength
with
the
peripheries
.
The
state
of
emergency
places
all
the
forces
of
order
under
the
authority
of
a
federal
Command
Post
,
with
Hailemariam
Dessalegn
at
its
head
and
the
Minister
of
Defense
as
its
secretary
.
They
thus
control
the
mono-ethnic
Special
Regional
Police
in
each
state
,
who
with
80,000
members
far
outnumber
the
Federal
Police
(
around
40,000
),
and
even
more
so
the
Army
Special
Force
(
the
famous
Agazi
red
berets
,
around
4000
).
The
500,000
or
so
militiamen
also
come
under
their
authority
.
That
is
why
the
proclamation
encountered
ferocious
opposition
within
the
OPDO
and
ANDM
.
Essentially
,
however
,
the
state
of
emergency
is
a
show
of
strength
.
Not
only
to
try
to
reassure
increasingly
nervous
foreign
investors
,
[
16
]
but
above
all
to
convince
the
population
of
the
regime’s
determination
to
recover
total
control
of
the
entire
country
by
any
means
–
the
obsession
of
any
Ethiopian
ruling
power
worthy
of
the
name
–
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
make
its
promise
of
reforms
credible
.
Otherwise
,
it
would
have
been
perceived
as
a
capitulation
.
Sebhat
Nega
,
patriarch
of
the
TPLF
,
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
state
of
emergency
was
“
to
create
a
situation
to
make
us
able
to
reform
”
.
[
17
]
Ultimately
,
the
aim
of
the
compromise
reached
within
the
party
was
to
drive
a
wedge
between
the
“
violent
,
extremist
and
armed
struggle
”
–
to
be
repressed
through
the
state
of
emergency
–
and
the
“
democratic
peaceful
engagement
”
expressed
by
so
many
demonstrators
–
holding
out
a
hand
via
reform
.
[
18
]
“
Leadership
has
miserably
failed
”
Interviews
with
senior
officials
cast
light
on
the
analysis
that
the
leadership
as
a
whole
finally
agreed
upon
.
Emollient
though
it
may
be
,
they
are
all
now
sticking
by
it
and
keeping
their
previous
disagreements
to
themselves
.
[
19
]
The
analysis
goes
as
follows
:
the
spirit
and
letter
of
the
constitution
are
perfect
,
as
are
therefore
the
federal
structure
,
the
format
of
the
institutions
,
the
political
line
.
The
latter
is
not
“
based
on
ideology
but
on
the
natural
laws
of
development
”,
as
it
previously
was
on
Marxist
“
science
”.
“
Show
me
a
developing
country
anywhere
in
the
world
which
has
a
political
strategy
and
guidelines
as
well
articulated
as
Ethiopia
!
”
This
perfection
has
accomplished
“
miracles
”
.
The
current
crisis
is
simply
“
the
price
of
our
successes
”.
It
was
preceded
and
will
be
followed
by
others
,
because
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
stage
,
unremarkable
and
inevitable
,
on
the
path
that
will
undoubtedly
culminate
in
the
nation
catching
up
with
developed
countries
in
the
next
few
decades
.
However
,
this
stage
,
like
any
other
,
requires
“
adjustments
”,
especially
as
the
society
–
richer
,
more
educated
,
more
mature
–
has
become
a
“
demanding
society
”.
The
young
in
particular
,
the
spearhead
of
protest
,
are
making
demands
that
are
socio-economic
rather
than
political
.
The
regime
is
facing
“
challenges
”
for
having
failed
to
make
these
adjustments
in
time
.
The
main
problem
is
deficiencies
in
implementation
.
In
sum
,
things
have
gone
off
the
rails
because
of
human
failings
.
Yielding
to
corruption
,
bad
governance
,
lack
of
accountability
,
etc
.,
“
l
eadership
at
various
levels
of
the
government
structure
has
miserably
failed
to
fully
and
timely[sic
]
address
the
demands
made
and
the
questions
raised
by
the
people
”.
[
20
]
The
response
to
the
crisis
must
therefore
take
two
forms
.
First
a
massive
purge
at
all
levels
of
the
Party
,
regional
governments
,
the
administration
.
Then
,
“
to
delineate
”
–
the
new
watchword
–
the
Party
from
the
government
,
from
the
Assemblies
,
from
justice
,
etc
.
in
order
to
develop
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
,
since
the
self-correcting
mechanisms
within
the
Party
have
proved
inadequate.The
essential
thing
is
“
to
discuss
…
with
all
stakeholders
”
in
all
possible
and
imaginable
“
debating
platforms
”
,
“
assemblies
”
,
“
fora
”
,
but
with
no
specific
goal
or
timetable
,
and
under
the
sole
authority
of
the
EPRDF
.
For
youth
employment
,
a
“
Mobile
Youth
Fund
”
funded
to
the
tune
of
500
million
dollars
–
some
4
%
of
the
annual
budget
–
will
be
created
,
though
the
details
are
vague
and
it
will
take
several
years
before
its
effects
are
felt
.
Above
all
,
it
is
part
of
a
largely
endogenous
strategy
of
industrialization
,
focused
on
Small
and
Medium
Enterprises
(
SME
)
on
the
edge
of
the
rural
areas
,
whereas
heated
debate
continues
within
the
leadership
with
those
who
advocate
prioritizing
foreign
investment
in
“
Industrial
Parks
”.

Anticipating
the
worst
What
emerges
from
all
the
interviews
with
nonofficial
contacts
is
that
the
expectation
of
a
symbolic
gesture
,
one
that
would
be
significant
and
have
immediate
impact
,
proving
that
the
regime
had
grasped
the
essence
of
the
crisis
and
wishes
sincerely
to
address
it
,
has
not
been
met
.
According
to
them
,
the
regime
is
relying
first
on
repression
,
and
on
reforms
only
as
a
“
footnote
”.
Merera
Gudina
,
a
long-standing
leader
of
the
opposition
,
sums
up
the
general
sentiment
:
“
too
little
,
too
late
”
.
[
23
]
Nothing
has
been
done
to
reach
out
to
either
the
main
opposition
forces
,
even
the
legal
opposition
,
nor
the
civil
society
or
the
media
,
quite
the
contrary
.
This
could
be
envisaged
only
after
the
end
of
the
state
of
emergency
,
Hailemariam
is
said
to
have
told
one
figure
from
the
international
community
.
These
interlocutors
share
the
dark
pessimism
of
an
editorial
in
the
Washington
Post
:
“
t
he
state
of
emergency
will
bottle
up
the
pressures
even
more
,
increasing
the
likelihood
they
will
explode
anew
…
It
won’t
work
”.
[
24
]
According
to
this
view
,
the
chances
of
a
genuine
opening
up
on
the
part
of
the
regime
are
so
small
that
there
is
a
high
probability
that
the
worst
will
happen
:
a
threat
to
the
very
survival
of
the
country
,
the
only
question
being
when
this
dislocation
would
occur
.
Washington
Post
:
“
t
he
state
of
emergency
…
It
won’t
work
”
While
the
official
media
bang
on
about
the
“
strong
commitment
”
of
the
leadership
“
to
make
its
promise
of
deep
reform
a
reality
”
,
[
25
]
interviews
with
top
officials
provide
hints
of
the
form
and
scope
of
reform
,
which
remain
consistent
with
the
official
analysis
of
the
crisis
.
Focus
on
“
service
delivery
”
There
is
no
urgency
:
change
will
be
“
an
ongoing
endless
process
”
.
The
first
specific
deadline
is
in
seven
months
,
in
June
2017
,
to
report
back
on
the
purge
and
examine
a
document
currently
in
preparation
,
on
what
the
EPRDF
should
become
in
the
next
ten
years
.
In
this
view
,
the
crisis
is
not
systemic
.
So
neither
the
constitution
,
nor
the
institutions
,
nor
the
political
line
will
be
touched
.
How
could
the
latter
be
challenged
since
it
obeys
universal
“
laws
”?
For
that
reason
,
regardless
of
all
the
promised
“
discussions
”,
no
convincing
reasons
are
given
for
the
much
touted
opening
up
to
entail
any
restructuring
of
the
political
arena
.
The
EPRDF
alone
,
as
sectarian
as
ever
,
has
understood
and
applies
these
“
laws
”,
whereas
the
opposition
parties
oppose
or
reject
them
.
The
EPRDF
alone
has
the
near
monopoly
of
skills
needed
to
implement
them
,
skills
that
the
other
parties
lack
.
In
short
,
the
opposition
is
still
not
“
constructive
”.
If
the
regime
needs
to
become
more
inclusive
,
it
is
essentially
in
material
terms
,
by
sharing
the
cake
more
fairly
through
improvements
in
“
service
delivery
”
.
To
do
this
,
it
is
necessary
and
sufficient
to
put
an
end
to
individual
erring
through
the
self-reform
of
the
EPRDF
,
i.e
.
reform
by
and
for
the
Party
itself
.
To
achieve
the
famous
“
delineation
”
,
MPs
,
judges
,
ministers
,
civil
servants
,
etc
.
would
split
themselves
in
two
,
remaining
obedient
to
the
Party
but
putting
their
mission
first
.
Why
would
they
do
this
,
given
that
they
never
have
before
?
“
Because
they
have
become
aware
of
the
crisis
”
,
is
the
explanation
.
So
responding
to
the
crisis
requires
no
systemic
reshaping
through
the
establishment
of
independent
counterforces
.
A
U-turn
in
individual
behaviour
will
be
enough.Why
would
they
do
this
,
given
that
they
never
have
before
?
The
EPRDF
sticks
to
the
same
age-old
paradigm
.
Since
Ethiopia
is
still
at
a
precapitalist
stage
,
the
intelligentsia
is
the
only
social
group
capable
of
setting
the
path
to
follow
and
leading
the
way
.
The
EPRDF
contains
its
best
elements
.
Ethnic
identities
continue
to
be
society’s
main
structuring
factor
.
The
EPRDF
alone
represents
them
.
As
one
senior
official
confirmed
,
it
is
not
until
the
country
enters
a
capitalist
stage
that
pluralism
will
imposed
itself
:
with
the
emergence
of
social
classes
,
each
will
construct
its
own
political
party
to
express
its
interests
.
What
the
EPRDF
is
still
seeking
is
not
simultaneous
development
AND
democracy
,
but
development
THEN
democracy
.
In
this
respect
,
the
arrival
of
technocrats
–
brandishing
the
indispensable
PhD
and
with
no
major
party
position
–
was
widely
interpreted
as
evidence
of
a
new
openness
in
the
cabinet
reshuffle
.
Yet
it
perpetuates
the
monopoly
rule
of
the
“
intellocracy
”.
The
paradox
of
the
strongman
The
consensus
reached
on
October
9
is
fragile
and
hence
precarious
.
Nothing
proves
that
the
“
reformers
”
have
won
the
long-term
game
,
though
they
have
scored
a
point
.
Deep
down
,
they
do
not
share
the
same
views
.
They
lack
a
standout
personality
to
act
as
a
leader
.
They
have
a
clear
view
of
where
they
want
to
go
,
which
is
to
apply
the
constitution
to
the
letter
,
but
over
a
very
long
timescale
and
with
no
precise
and
concerted
idea
of
the
steps
needed
to
get
there
.
As
for
their
rank-and-file
adherents
,
they
make
no
secret
of
still
embracing
the
same
paradox
:
we
need
reforms
,
but
we
need
a
new
strongman
to
manage
and
impose
them
,
for
fear
that
they
will
otherwise
lead
to
chaos.We
need
reforms
,
but
we
need
a
new
strongman
to
manage
and
impose
them
.
On
the
opposition
side
,
all
the
Oromo
we
spoke
to
emphasized
the
generational
gap
between
the
educated
youth
,
broadly
aged
16
to
25
,
spearhead
of
the
protests
notably
in
Oromya
,
and
their
elders
.
The
latter
are
ambivalent
.
They
feel
a
sincere
empathy
for
the
grievances
and
aspirations
of
the
younger
generation
,
but
have
reservations
,
even
hostility
,
regarding
the
violent
methods
sometimes
employed
.
In
some
cases
they
even
physically
opposed
attempts
at
destruction
during
the
“
five
days
of
rage
”
.
[
26
]
They
remain
traumatized
by
the
Civil
War
under
the
previous
regime
,
the
Derg
.
Then
they
acquired
military
know-how
that
the
young
activists
don’t
have
.
The
latter
also
lack
coordination
and
leadership
.
For
all
these
reasons
,
a
historian
of
armed
popular
uprisings
in
Ethiopia
in
the
twentieth
century
has
concluded
that
it
is
unlikely
that
the
protests
could
become
a
significant
guerrilla
campaign
,
or
that
a
sustained
armed
peasant
upsurge
–
a
“
jacquerie
”
could
occur
.
As
for
the
pockets
of
insurrection
that
have
appeared
in
the
Amhara
region
,
they
mainly
affect
areas
where
the
authorities
’
control
has
always
been
weak
,
even
essentially
formal
.
Ethiopian
history
teaches
that
a
regime
only
falls
if
its
forces
of
repression
,
or
at
least
part
of
them
,
turn
against
it
.
Today
,
apart
from
a
few
unconfirmed
incidents
,
cohesion
seems
to
be
holding
,
say
experts
close
to
them
.
It
might
only
break
down
if
the
EPRDF
became
divided
to
the
point
of
being
torn
apart
by
centrifugal
forces
.
However
,
the
military
command
has
always
let
it
be
known
that
it
would
intervene
before
this
happened
,
as
ultimate
saviour
of
the
regime
.
Under
these
circumstances
,
steady
deterioration
–
a
kind
of
rotting
,
seems
a
possible
scenario
.
Under
these
circumstances
,
steady
deterioration
–
a
kind
of
rotting
,
seems
a
possible
scenario
.
Without
any
substantive
resolution
,
the
regime
could
re-establish
law
and
order
,
as
the
first
effects
of
the
state
of
emergency
seem
to
suggest
.
The
reforms
would
not
tackle
the
core
problems
.
The
ruling
power
would
remain
contested
and
delegitimized
but
,
in
the
absence
of
an
alternative
,
Ethiopians
would
toe
the
line
.
Investors
would
remain
cautious
,
not
to
say
skittish
,
affecting
economic
growth
.
But
neither
of
the
two
opposing
camps
would
gain
the
upper
hand
,
any
more
than
they
would
reach
a
constructive
compromise
.
Ultimately
,
what
might
possibly
occur
is
a
classic
scenario
in
Ethiopian
history
:
the
demise
of
one
strongman
,
followed
by
a
period
of
great
disorder
until
a
new
strongman
takes
up
the
reins
.

Ethiopian
protesters
attack
factories
in
Africa's
rising
economic
star
ADDIS
ABABA
(
Reuters
)
-
Protesters
in
Ethiopia
damaged
almost
a
dozen
mostly
foreign-owned
factories
and
flower
farms
and
destroyed
scores
of
vehicles
this
week
,
adding
economic
casualties
to
a
rising
death
toll
in
a
wave
of
unrest
over
land
grabs
and
rights
.
The
violence
has
cast
a
shadow
over
a
nation
where
a
state-led
industrial
drive
has
created
one
of
Africa's
fastest
growing
economies
,
but
where
the
government
has
also
faced
rising
international
criticism
and
popular
opposition
to
its
authoritarian
approach
to
development
.
The
flare-up
followed
the
death
of
at
least
55
people
in
a
stampede
on
Sunday
when
police
fired
tear
gas
and
shot
into
the
air
to
disperse
demonstrators
in
the
Oromiya
region
near
the
capital
.
It
raises
to
more
than
450
the
number
of
people
rights
groups
and
opponents
say
have
been
killed
in
unrest
since
2015
.
A
U.S
.
researcher
was
killed
on
Tuesday
when
her
car
was
attacked
by
stone-throwers
near
Addis
Ababa
.
The
government
says
the
toll
cited
by
critics
is
inflated
.
Fana
Broadcasting
,
which
is
seen
as
close
to
the
state
,
reported
on
its
website
that
11
companies
ranging
from
textile
firms
to
a
plastics
maker
to
flower
farms
had
been
damaged
or
destroyed
,
while
more
than
60
vehicles
had
been
torched
.
Dutch
firm
FV
SeleQt
said
its
300-hectare
vegetable
farm
and
warehouse
had
been
plundered
.
Another
Dutch
firm
,
Africa
Juice
,
said
its
factory
had
been
partially
destroyed
.
The
manager
of
one
of
the
Turkish
companies
,
textile
firm
Saygin
Dima
,
told
Reuters
this
week
at
least
a
third
of
his
factory
was
burned
down
.
Fana's
website
showed
images
of
burned-out
trucks
on
the
road
side
,
blaming
the
damage
on
"
perpetrators
of
violence
",
echoing
the
line
taken
by
the
government
,
which
accuses
local
rebel
groups
and
dissidents
based
abroad
for
stoking
the
unrest
.
It
said
the
firms
damaged
had
created
40,000
jobs
in
a
country
of
99
million
people
that
has
long
been
blighted
by
famine
but
which
has
been
rapidly
transforming
its
fortunes
,
delivering
growth
rates
that
hit
10
percent
in
fiscal
2015/16
.

seizing
their
land
and
offering
tiny
compensation
,
before
selling
it
on
to
companies
,
often
foreign
investors
,
at
inflated
prices
.
They
also
say
they
struggle
to
find
work
,
even
when
a
new
factory
is
sited
on
property
they
or
their
families
once
owned
.
"
I
went
to
apply
for
a
job
at
a
steel
factory
that
was
built
on
my
family’s
land
but
I
was
turned
away
when
they
discovered
I
was
the
son
of
the
previous
land
owner
,”
said
Mulugeta
,
who
asked
for
only
his
first
name
to
be
used
to
avoid
any
state
reprisals
.
"
Most
factories
give
priority
to
employees
from
other
regions
for
fear
local
people
would
one
day
stage
strikes
,"
he
said
,
speaking
by
telephone
from
Oromiya
where
he
now
drives
a
truck
for
another
company
.
In
Ethiopia
,
once
ruled
by
Marxists
whose
draconian
policies
drove
the
nation
into
a
devastating
1984
famine
,
all
land
still
belongs
to
the
state
and
owners
are
only
deemed
leaseholders
,
even
if
they
have
been
living
or
farming
there
for
generations
.
For
the
state
,
it
means
a
swift
and
legally
uncomplicated
route
to
ejecting
leaseholders
to
make
way
for
new
factories
and
construction
of
highways
and
railways
,
including
a
750-km
electrified
line
opened
this
week
that
links
the
capital
of
landlocked
Ethiopia
with
Djibouti's
busy
sea
port
.
For
the
opposition
and
those
turfed
out
of
farm
plots
where
they
grow
food
for
their
families
,
it
shows
how
the
government
that
has
ruled
for
quarter
of
a
century
tramples
on
their
rights
.
"
It
is
time
for
the
government
to
change
tack
,"
said
Merera
Gudina
,
chairman
of
the
opposition
Oromo
Federalist
Congress
.
"
People
are
demanding
change
,
but
the
problem
is
the
only
language
the
government
knows
is
the
use
of
excessive
force
."
The
government
says
police
have
clashed
with
what
it
calls
"
armed
gangs
"
intent
on
destabilizing
the
nation
.
A
regional
Oromo
official
accused
protesters
of
hindering
efforts
to
reverse
generations
of
poverty
in
Oromiya
.
Pressure
has
been
mounting
from
abroad
too
.
U.S
.
President
Barack
Obama
told
his
Ethiopian
hosts
in
Addis
Ababa
last
year
that
greater
political
openness
would
"
strengthen
rather
than
inhibit
"
the
development
agenda
.
The
government
said
it
differed
over
the
pace
of
any
reforms
demanded
by
Washington
.
"
Economic
development
has
outpaced
political
change
,"
said
former
U.S
.
ambassador
to
Ethiopia
and
academic
David
Shinn
.
Noting
"
phenomenal
"
economic
gains
,
he
said
:
"
It
is
less
clear
,
however
,
whether
the
Ethiopian
peasant
farmer
,
who
still
constitutes
about
80
percent
of
the
population
,
has
benefited
significantly
."
Feeling
the
Heat
Foreign
investors
are
feeling
the
heat
from
protesters
,
not
because
they
are
foreigners
but
because
they
are
among
the
biggest
purchasers
of
the
new
land
leases
from
the
state
.
Ethiopia's
budding
tourist
industry
is
also
taking
a
hit
.
The
Bishangari
Lodge
,
on
Lake
Langano
about
200
km
south
of
Addis
Ababa
,
was
looted
and
torched
this
week
.
Resort
owner
Omar
Bagersh
said
,
even
before
the
attack
,
he
had
had
90
percent
cancellations
in
the
past
two
or
three
months
.
"
It
is
very
difficult
to
convince
a
tourist
to
travel
to
a
country
that
has
this
kind
of
situation
,"
he
said
.
Investors
have
been
attracted
by
cheap
electricity
from
Ethiopia's
huge
new
hydroelectric
dams
being
built
,
cheap
labor
,
improving
transport
and
tax
incentives
offered
by
a
financially
stretched
government
hungry
for
foreign
exchange
.
New
industries
have
been
focused
in
Oromiya
and
the
nearby
Amhara
regions
,
which
surround
Addis
Ababa
,
a
city
that
now
boasts
Sub-Saharan
Africa's
only
light
rail
metro
system
and
a
rapidly
rising
skyline
.
Protests
in
Oromiya
province
initially
erupted
in
2014
over
a
development
plan
for
the
capital
that
would
have
expanded
its
boundaries
,
a
move
seen
as
threatening
farmland
.
Clashes
with
police
flared
in
2015
and
this
year
,
although
the
government
has
shelved
the
boundary
plan
.
Protesters
have
increasingly
focused
on
broader
political
issues
,
accusing
the
government
of
stifling
opposition
.
The
government
,
which
won
a
parliamentary
election
in
2015
in
which
the
opposition
failed
to
secure
a
single
seat
,
denies
this
.
(
The
story
corrects
in
17th
paragraph
to

of
"

")
Yes
,
Ethiopia
has
problems
–
but
this
drought
is
no
1984
rerun
When
the
BBC’s
Michael
Buerk
brought
Ethiopian
famine
to
the
world’s
attention
in
1984
,
the
footage
panned
over
thousands
of
people
on
the
brink
of
starvation
in
the
region
of
North
Wollo
.
A
BBC
report
this
week
,
filmed
in
the
same
drought-stricken
area
,
focused
on
one
mother’s
loss
of
her
son
to
hunger
.
But
it
was
an
indication
that
although
Ethiopia
still
suffers
preventable
tragedies
,
it
may
well
have
gained
the
capability
to
prevent
catastrophe
.
A
statement
from
the
Ethiopian
embassy
in
London
was
quick
to
challenge
yesterday’s
report
:
“
The
sensational
news
broadcast
by
BBC
TV
,
regarding
children
dying
on
a
daily
basis
,
does
not
reflect
the
current
broad
reality
on
the
ground
and
the
full
preparation
that
has
gone
into
overcoming
the
problem
.”
On
the
ground
the
government
is
responding
to
the
latest
crisis
,
but
,
as
with
past
disasters
,
it
has
been
slow
to
admit
its
severity
.
The
country
is
,
after
all
,
pushing
a
narrative
of
breakneck
development
–
it
says
annual
economic
growth
averaged
10
%
over
the
past
decade
,
driven
partly
by
ever
increasing
agricultural
productivity
.
Millions
of
Ethiopians
share
the
official
anger
that
their
ancient
,
diverse
nation
is
associated
so
frequently
with
misery
in
western
minds
.
There
is
little
question
that
Ethiopia
has
progressed
since
its
last
revolution
ended
in
1991
,
but
the
fact
that
millions
have
been
shown
to
still
be
so
vulnerable
runs
counter
to
that
prevailing
narrative
.
While
few
doubt
that
a
relatively
small
economy
has
grown
quickly
,
an
even
smaller
number
believe
crop-production
data
is
credible
.
Some
statistics
show
the
weaknesses
.
The
UN
reported
that
spending
on
basic
public
services
dramatically
reduced
Ethiopia’s
poverty
rate
between
2005
and
2012
.
However
,
that
left
the
absolute
number
of
very
poor
the
same
at
25
million
,
due
to
population
increases
.
Aid
and
government
funds
have
poured
into
a
raft
of
agricultural
modernisation
initiatives
,
but
around
90
%
of
crops
still
rely
solely
on
rain
.
The
harshness
of
this
drought
stems
from
events
beyond
Ethiopia’s
control
.
Increasingly
erratic
rainfall
patterns
have
been
exacerbated
by
the
ocean-warming
trend
El
Niño
.
Currently
8.2
million
people
out
of
an
estimated
population
of
99
million
need
aid
.
That
could
rise
to
15
million
in
2016
as
food
stocks
run
out
and
rains
fail
again
,
according
to
the
UN
.
There’s
no
tally
of
lives
lost
so
far
,
but
there
are
also
no
horror
scenes
comparable
to
those
that
Buerk
witnessed
;
and
aid
workers
insist
famine-like
conditions
won’t
develop
if
the
government
is
adequately
supported
.
Still
,
the
indicators
are
worrying
.
The
UN
reports
that
acute
malnutrition
rates
in
September
were
20
%
higher
than
the
previous
year
.
On
13
October
an
appeal
was
launched
for
£225m
to
help
those
affected
for
the
remainder
of
this
year
alone
,
and
perhaps
another
£500m
will
be
needed
as
the
crisis
deepens
over
the
next
10
months
.
Since
September
rich
nations
have
given
£80m
and
Ethiopia’s
agriculture
ministry
is
buying
400,000
tons
of
wheat
.
The
response
of
the
government
,
which
says
it’s
allocating
£130m
for
relief
efforts
,
has
been
praised
by
the
international
community
.
These
efforts
are
in
stark
contrast
to
30
years
ago
.
When
the
famine
that
led
to
the
Live
Aid
appeal
hit
,
Ethiopia
was
a
nation
ill
prepared
to
cope
.
A
cabal
of
junior
military
officers
had
ruthlessly
consolidated
power
in
the
decade
since
the
overthrow
of
Haile
Selassie
.
The
junta’s
hijacking
of
a
revolution
–
twisting
a
feudal
society
into
a
socialist
command
economy
–
triggered
rebellions
in
the
north
.
The
famine
was
as
much
a
product
of
civil
unrest
as
it
was
of
drought
.
Those
political
and
economic
conditions
no
longer
exist
.
The
government
faces
no
significant
armed
opposition
and
a
state-heavy
market
economy
operates
.
Donor-supported
social
welfare
systems
for
the
most
vulnerable
have
been
institutionalised
for
a
decade
.
Funding
is
in
place
for
that
safety-net
programme
to
support
around
7
million
people
for
six
months
next
year
.
But
Ethiopia
,
which
still
relies
significantly
on
foreign
assistance
,
cannot
manage
this
crisis
alone
.
But
donors
may
not
see
this
as
the
most
pressing
emergency
.
The
Syrian
refugee
crisis
,
for
one
,
is
an
obvious
priority
for
European
officials
.
Even
in
the
Horn
of
Africa
,
there
are
crises
in
Eritrea
,
South
Sudan
,
Sudan
and
Somalia
.
The
twin
dynamics
of
Ethiopia’s
relative
–
if
overstated
–
development
and
a
world
riddled
by
humanitarian
problems
cloud
the
response
.
Before
the
number
of
needy
almost
doubled
to
more
than
8
million
,
Ethiopian
ministers
argued
that
food
surpluses
and
disaster
planning
meant
they
didn’t
need
help
.
But
as
the
situation
worsened
,
the
tone
shifted
.
Hailemariam
Desalegn
,
the
prime
minister
,
visited
affected
regions
,
and
the
government
made
an
unambiguous
appeal
for
aid
.
Given
the
urgency
of
the
situation
,
and
the
competition
for
funds
,
this
delay
was
harmful
.
The
BBC’s
report
may
now
have
a
catalytic
effect
on
a
sluggish
fund-raising
effort
.

BACKGROUND
1.1
.
Introduction
The
multi-agency
Flood
Task
Force
(
FTF
)
issued
an
Alert
for
Unseasonal
Rainfall
and
Flood
in
October
2015
to
raise
awareness
of
anticipated
flood
risk
in
Wabe
Shebelle
,
Genale/Dawa
,
and
southeastern
parts
of
the
country
.
The
DRMFSS-led
FTF
prepared
this
flood
Contingency
Plan
(
CP
)
in
order
to
mitigate
the
adverse
impacts
of
flooding
.
The
CP
identifies
the
most
likely
scenario
based
on
the
weather
forecast
and
analysis
of
the
preparedness
and
response
capacity
for
the
flood
anticipated
areas
.
The
NMA
forecast
for
bega
,
which
formed
the
basis
for
the
development
of
the
Alert
and
this
CP
,
warns
that
flooding
is
anticipated
in
the
southern
and
provides
flood-related
requirements
by
sector
for
the
bega
(
October
2015
to
January
2016
)
period
,
including
other
mitigation
and
preparedness
efforts
.
Since
the
beginning
of
bega
season
,
incidents
of
flooding
were
reported
in
East
Imey
,
Mustahil
and
Kelafo
woredas
of
Shebelle
zone
in
Somali
region
due
to
the
overflow
of
the
Wabe
Shebelle
River
(
East
Imey
)
and
flash
flood
.
Evacuation
of
at-risk
population
to
safer/higher
grounds
was
undertaken
in
Mustahil
and
Kelafo
woredas
.
1.2
El
Niño
According
to
NMA
2015
bega
weather
outlook
,
there
is
a
high
probability
of
El
Niño
to
cause
above-normal
rainfall
in
the
October
to
January
2016
period
leading
to
flooding
in
the
south
and
south
eastern
parts
of
the
country
.
The
El
Niño
effect
is
anticipated
to
persist
until
January
2016
.
This
indicates
the
prevalence
of
dry
conditions
,
unseasonal
rainfall
and
normal
to
above-normal
rainfall
as
indicated
in
the
forecast
below
.
1.3
Forecast
for
bega
2015
The
NMA
identified
the
years
1982/83
and
1997/98
as
El
Niño
analogue
years
.
The
outlook
also
indicates
that
the
season
(
October
2015
to
January
2016
)
will
be
characterized
by
effects
of
El
Niño
global
episodes
.
This
phenomenon
is
expected
to
result
in
following
.
•
Above-normal
rainfall
performance
is
anticipated
to
dominate
across
the
south
and
southeastern
parts
of
the
country
.
Heavy
fall
is
likely
to
prevail
over
some
pocket
areas
.
•
Unseasonal
(
above-normal
)
rainfall
is
expected
in
the
northern
,
northeastern
,
eastern
and
central
parts
of
Ethiopia
.
•
Normal
rainfall
is
anticipated
predominantly
in
southwestern
and
western
parts
of
the
country
.
•
Normal
to
above-normal
rainfall
is
likely
in
northwestern
parts
of
the
country
.
•
The
chance
for
the
prevalence
of
frost
in
the
highland
areas
is
minimal
.
Despite
overall
dry
weather
conditions
,
above
normal
to
above
normal
rainfall
is
anticipated
in
central
,
eastern
and
southern
Tigray
of
Tigray
,
Awi
zone
,
Bahdar
Zuria
,
west
and

and
most
parts
of

Regions
during
the
2nd
dekad
of

2015
.
In
general
according
to
the
NMA
decadal
forecast
(
2rd
dekad
of
November
2015
),
the
expected
heavy
rainfall
will
likely
cause
flash
floods
in
some
parts
of
SNNP
,
Southern
Oromia
and
Somali
Regions
.
Ethiopia
protests
resurge
after
stampede
deaths
Often
violent
protests
in
which
rights
groups
say
hundreds
of
people
have
been
killed
by
security
forces
have
flared
again
in
Ethiopia
,
with
a
US
citizen
among
the
latest
deaths
.
Protests
reignited
in
the
Oromia
region
-
the
main
focus
of
a
wave
of
anti-government
demonstrations
that
began
in
November
-
in
recent
days
after
at
least
55
people
were
killed
in
a
stampede
over
the
weekend
,
sparked
by
police
firing
tear
gas
and
warning
shots
at
a
huge
crowd
of
protesters
at
a
religious
festival
.
Fifty-five
is
the
official
death
toll
given
by
the
government
,
though
opposition
activists
and
rights
groups
say
they
believe
more
than
100
people
died
as
they
fled
security
forces
,
falling
into
ditches
that
dotted
the
area
.
Ethiopian
radio
said
excavators
had
to
be
used
to
remove
some
of
the
bodies
.
The
demonstrations
started
among
the
Oromo
,
Ethiopia's
biggest
ethnic
group
,
and
later
spread
to
the
Amhara
,
the
second
most
populous
group
.
Though
they
initially
began
over
land
rights
they
later
broadened
into
calls
for
more
political
,
economic
and
cultural
rights
.
Both
groups
say
that
a
multi-ethnic
ruling
coalition
and
the
security
forces
are
dominated
by
the
Tigray
ethnic
group
,
which
makes
up
about
six
percent
of
the
population
.
The
government
,
though
,
blames
rebel
groups
and
foreign-based
dissidents
for
stoking
the
violence
.
Staff
at
the
California-based
UC
Davis
university
confirmed
the
identity
of
the
US
citizen
as
Sharon
Gray
,
a
postdoctoral
researcher
of
biology
,
who
had
been
in
the
Horn
of
Africa
nation
to
attend
a
meeting
.
The
US
embassy
said
she
was
killed
on
Tuesday
when
stones
were
hurled
at
her
vehicle
on
the
outskirts
of
Addis
Ababa
,
where
residents
said
crowds
have
attacked
other
vehicles
since
the
stampede
.
The
embassy
did
not
give
further

The

Ethiopia
to
Receive
$97
Million
in
Additional
Emergency
Food
Assistance
from
the
US
The
U.S
.
Agency
for
International
Development
(
USAID
)
announced
it
is
providing
nearly
$97
million
in
additional
food
assistance
to
assist
vulnerable
populations
in
Ethiopia
,
including
those
severely
affected
by
the
impacts
of
the
recent
drought
.
The
contribution
provided
by
USAID’s
Office
of
Food
for
Peace
includes
more
than
154,000
tons
of
emergency
food
assistance
to
address
food
needs
of
approximately
3.5
million
Ethiopians
as
well
as
refugees
from
Somalia
,
South
Sudan
and
Eritrea
who
have
fled
conflict
in
their
own
countries
.
USAID
is
contributing
$58
million
to
its
partner
Catholic
Relief
Services
for
105,700
tons
of
U.S
.
food
;
providing
$19
million
to
the
UN
World
Food
Program
(
WFP
)
for
its
drought
relief
operation
,
and
$20
million
for
its
refugee
assistance
.
The
United
States
has
also
pre-positioned
relief
commodities
in
Ethiopia
to
meet
anticipated
increased
needs
from
El
Niño
.
The
El
Niño
has
significantly
impacted
weather
patterns
in
Ethiopia
this
year
,
limiting
agricultural
production
,
straining
livelihoods
,
and
exacerbating
food
insecurity
among
poor
and
vulnerable
households
.
The
projected
level
of
need
for
emergency
aid
in
Ethiopia
has
grown
from
2.9
million
people
in
early
2015
to
4.5
million
people
in
August
to
8.2
million
people
as
of
October
.
As
El
Niño
progresses
into
2016
,
Ethiopia
is
likely
to
experience
both
prolonged
drought
and
intense
flooding
that
will
further
deteriorate
food
security
.
According
to
the
United
Nations
the
up
to
15
million
people
will
be
in
need
of
food
aid
by
the
beginning
of
2016
.
“
Improved
early
warning
,
the
establishment
of
the
Productive
Safety
Net
Program
,
as
well
as
serious
engagement
by
the
Government
of
Ethiopia
to
analyze
and
respond
to
the
ongoing
El
Niño
crisis
means
that
we
are
not
likely
to
see
,”
said
Dina
Esposito
,
Director
of
USAID’s
Office
of
Food
for
Peace
.
According
to
Dina
Esposito
,
Director
of
USAID’s
Office
of
Food
for
Peace
the
kind
of
catastrophic
famine
conditions
of
earlier
decades
is
unlikely
to
be
witnessed
this
time
.
However
,
“
it
is
not
cause
for
complacency
.
Given
that
we
are
witnessing
the
driest
conditions
ever
recorded
in
parts
of
Ethiopia
,
we
know
the
magnitude
of
the
need
will
require
far
more
robust
support
globally
than
what
has
currently
been
pledged
.
With
these
early
contributions
we
aim
to
demonstrate
the
United
States
’
deep
concern
over
rapidly
expanding
relief
requirements
and
send
a
signal
to
other
donors
to
respond
generously
as
well
.”

with
other
donors

supported
the

since
2005

And
since

Spread

News

The
Addis
Ababa
City
Health
Bureau
said
cholera
was
fast
spreading
in
the
city
and
it
could
not
control
the
pace
of
the
spread
of
the
disease
.
The
Bureau
said
the
number
of
people
infected
every
day
with
the
waterborne
disease
is
staggering
.
The
Bureau
blames
residents
for
failing
to
strictly
adhere
to
prevention
mechanisms
but
health
professionals
say
the
absence
of
clean
potable
water
in
the
city
was
the
culprit
.
Several
people
use
infected
river
water
as
residents
face
water
shut
off
for
days
on
end
.
Health
education
campaign
by
the
Bureau
to
sensitize
the
residents
has
done
little
in
stopping
the
spread
of
the
disease
.
Last
month
,
the
outbreak
of
cholera
in
the
capital
claimed
the
lives
of
six
people
.
The
land
issue
--&gt;
The
land
market
is
currently
the
most
important
issue
for
the
country
in
a
global
sense
.
Ukraine
today
is
a
major
exporter
,
the
leader
in
terms
of
supply
of
many
agricultural
products
.
But
it
is
still
unattractive
to
foreign
investors
,
because
they
ask
a
fair
question
,
which
is
the
key
to
the
country`s
stability
:
what
about
land
market
?
Rules
of
the
game
,
now
operating
on
the
Ukrainian
land
market
are
not
clear
for
the
developed
countries
.
How
could
we
not
proud
of
their
export
achievements
in
the
international
markets
,
agricultural
potential
and
the
presence
of
agro-looking
projects
-
all
this
is
not
in
a
position
to
influence
positively
to
attract
large
investments
.
As
yet
not
regulated
the
land
legislation
,
and
we
are
staying
for
an
international
investor
"
incomprehensible
"
and
high-risk
market
.
And
above
all
,
every
day
we
lose
potential
investment
resources
that
can
provide
growth
of
capacities
and
speed
up
the
country`s
exit
from
the
crisis
.
The
question
of
lifting
the
moratorium
is
now
ambiguous
because
on
the
one
hand
everyone
understands
that
a
free
land
market
we
need
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
obvious
that
we
are
not
ready
to
it
.
And
it`s
not
that
a
large
number
of
land
cadastre
needs
to
be
adjusted
,
and
the
regulatory
and
monetary
valuation
of
land
does
not
meet
the
realities
.
All
these
technical
aspects
.
The
main
problem
is
that
the
state
is
not
ready
to
give
up
a
"
good
Cush
",
which
it
receives
for
the
management
of
land
relations
.
And
it
will
do
everything
possible
to
retain
these
powers
.
An
example
is
draft
law
"
On
Circulation
of
land
agricultural
purposes
"
designed
State
Service
of
Cadastre
,
which
essentially
retains
monopoly
powers
in
the
sphere
of
land
relations
in
the
above
state
institution
.
The
same
State
Service
of
Cadastre
blocks
the
passage
of
the
bill
1159
on
strengthening
the
role
of
local
communities
in
land
management
.
The
law
actually
sells
land
outside
settlements
in
the
ownership
of
rural
and
village
councils
.
The
system
really
does
not
want
to
surrender
their
positions
.
Therefore
,
the
business
is
an
urgent
need
to
bring
a
consolidated
position
on
the
timing
of
lifting
of
the
moratorium
on
the
ground
and
to
take
part
in
the
drafting
of
legislation
,
which
will
form
the
basis
of
the
land
reform
.
Floods
following
drought
worsen
Ethiopian
hunger
Stuck
on
a
track
in
eastern
Ethiopia
,
trucks
carrying
food
for
the
starving
are
forced
to
turn
back
.
After
one
of
the
worst
droughts
for
decades
,
the
rains
have
finally
arrived
,
but
now
only
add
to
the
complication
of
the
delivery
of
food
aid
.
Flash
floods
have
effectively
transformed
dry
dirt
tracks
into
impassable
quagmires
,
adding
to
the
woes
of
the
victims
in
remote
areas

some
of
whom
have
received
no

for
weeks

has
pushed
10.2
million
Ethiopians
into
dire
conditions
needing
food
aid
to
survive
,
according
to
the
United

.
Here
in
Sitti
province
,
in
the
far
east
of
the
Horn
of
African

,
times
were
tough
even
before

The
region
is
classified
as

according
to
UN

one
step
short

In

small
village
of
Derela
,
cattle
herders
come
from

Dozens
of
carcasses
of

testify
to
the
magnitude
of
the

From

"
Without

,
there
was
no
hope
,"
he
said
.
"
We
heard
that
here
we
could
have
food
and

."
Floods
and
failed
rains
caused
by
the
El

weather
phenomenon
have
sparked
a
dramatic
rise
in
the
number
of
people
going

in
large
parts
of
Africa
,
with
southern
Ethiopia
an
area
of
especial
concern
.
-
Food
and
funding
gaps
-
Food
insecurity
is
a
sensitive
issue
in
Ethiopia
,
which
enjoys
near-double-digit
economic
growth
,
but
which
has
struggled
to
change
its
image
following
the
famine
of
1984-85
which
followed
an
extreme
drought
.
"
A
drought
like
this
is
unheard
of
,"
added
Mohamed
Aden
,
the
leader
of
the
community
,
a
few
huts
away
.
In
two
years
,
three
consecutive
seasons
of
rains
were
abnormally
low
,
a
situation
attributed
to
El
Nino
.
"
At
the
beginning
,
we
sold
the
livestock
to
buy
food
.
Without
help
,
we
would
have
only
the
skin
of
animals
to
eat

said
Aden
.
Children

a
bowl
of
porridge
a

at

and
their
families
get
wheat
rations
distributed
by
the

often
irregularly
.
Despite
these
efforts
,
malnutrition
has
reached
grim
levels
:
350,000
children
under
five
years
were
treated
for
severe
malnutrition
in
Ethiopia
in
2015
,
a
figure
expected
to
reach
450,000
in
2016
,
according
to
the
UN

.
In
Malkashek

the
mobile

measures
the

Last

,
136
cases

severe
malnutrition
were
registered
in
this

Ethiopia’s
Unrest
Sparked
by
Unequal
Development
Record
Ethiopia
is
experiencing
a
new
round
of
turmoil
.
The
mass
demonstrations
that
started
in
November
2015
have
continued
long
into
this
year
and
led
to
severe
state
repression
.
More
than
600
people
have
been
killed
by
security
forces
,
thousands
injured
,
and
tens
of
thousands
arrested
as
of
this
month
.
The
story
is
somewhat
familiar
,
however
,
as
many
rounds
of
political
and
ethnic-based
clashes
have
occurred
in
the
country
since
1991
,
when
the
current
regime
took
power
at
the
end
of
a
civil
war
.
This
time
around
,
the
mass
protests
of
students
,
youth
,
the
poor
,
and
others
started
peacefully
.
There
was
no
agenda
of
armed
insurrection
“
fed
by
diaspora
Ethiopians
and
foreigners
,”
as
the
government
likes
to
assert
.
But
early
in
September
they
turned
into
a
full-blown
revolt
,
notably
in
the
northern
Amhara
region—populated
largely
by
Amharic-speaking
people—which
has
felt
marginalized
for
years
.
As
government
repression
hardened
,
locals
attacked
administrative
offices
,
police
stations
,
and
army
units
(
some
members
of
which
defected
to
their
cause
).
Although
information
is
very
sketchy
,
it
is
reported
that
in
some
districts
authorities
have
been
chased
out
and
local
committees
have
taken
over
.
The
current
phase
of
protests
has
predictably
drawn
the
attention
of
the
foreign
press
and
Western
donor
countries
due
to
threats
to
investments—including
in
the
country’s
valuable
cut
flower
industry—and
the
many
people
killed
in
the
streets
.
Ethiopia
is
in
a
rapid
process
of
major
socioeconomic
transformation
,
with
growth
rates
of
some
10
%
annually
during
the
past
decade
.
It
is
popular
with
foreign
investors
due
to
its
cheap
and
abundant
labor
force
,
a
relatively
effective—though
highly
authoritarian—state
and
bureaucracy
,
and
the
availability
of
land
,
all
of
which
remains
state
property
and
is
handed
out
in
leases
.
The
Ethiopian
regime
has
smartly
catered
to
global
capitalism’s
search
for
new
areas
of
profit
,
but
it
has
kept
its
hands
on
the
reins
of
the
economy
.
Ethiopia’s
stability
compared
to
neighboring
Somalia
,
Sudan
,
South
Sudan
,
and
even
Kenya
,
has
also
been
highly
valued
.
That
stability
is
,
however
,
only
relative
and
temporary
,
owing
to
unresolved
issues
of
political
freedom
and
social
justice
.
These
underlie
the
current
wave
of
revolt
.
Ethnic
and
Geographic
Causes
The
protests
since
November
last
year—preceded
by
many
smaller-scale
clashes
in
previous
years
in
various
regions—originated
in
the
Oromiya
region
and
led
to
the
first
round
of
repression
.
According
to
Human
Rights
Watch
,
some
400
people
were
killed
by
police
and
army
forces
firing
into
crowds
of
demonstrators
,
with
many
thousands
arrested
.
Under
the
ethnic-based
federal
system
,
Oromiya
and
Amhara
are
the
two
biggest
regional
states
,
which
are
the
largest
sub-national
administrative
regions
and
defined
along
ethno-linguistic
lines
.
Protests
in
the
two
regions
pose
a
great
danger
to
the
federal
government
,
which
,
according
to
most
observers
,
is
dominated
by
the
northern
Tigray
minority
from
the
state
of
the
same
name
.
This
risk
is
especially
high
in
the
event
of
the
protests
becoming
coordinated
across
regions
.
Significant
historical
tensions
between
the
Amhara
and
Oromo
peoples
mean
the
prospect
of
such
action
is
moot
,
yet
the
ruling
Ethiopian
Peoples
’
Revolutionary
Democratic
Front
has
undoubtedly
created
a
sense
of
persistent
dissatisfaction
among
these
two
large
populations
.
The
explosion
of
pent-up
anger
appears
fueled
by
issues
of
humiliation
and
discrimination
caused
by
Ethiopia’s
regionally
skewed
and
ethnic-based
politics
.
It
is
notable
,
however
,
that
the
protests
are
not
a
result
of
an
“
ethnic
agenda
”;
they
are
primarily
directed
against
the
lack
of
political
and
civic
freedoms
,
inequities
in
the
land
use
system
,
and
social
injustice
.
The
disputes
over
land—which
is
closely
tied
to
heritage
and
identity—have
been
central
to
the
demonstrations
,
even
though
private
ownership
has
been
outlawed
since
1975
.
Territorial
identities
are
still
quite
strong
and
sometimes
reinforced
by
ethnicity
.
In
November
,
the
government
proclaimed
the
territorial
extension
of
the
Addis
Ababa
Master
Plan
,
which
increased
the
capital
city’s
boundaries
tenfold
at
the
cost
of
the
surrounding
Oromiya
region
.
This
measure
,
combined
with
the
ongoing
appropriation
of
local
farmland
for
the
benefit
of
foreign
and
domestic
investment
projects—among
them
Dutch-owned
flower
farms—led
to
Oromo
students
protesting
at
Addis
Ababa
University
.
Later
,
this
expanded
to
protests
in
rural
areas
,
during
which
several
flower
farms
were
burned
down
.
These
were
sites
of
resentment
for
locals
,
who
were
never
consulted
or
even
asked
to
cooperate
on
their
establishment
.
Attacking
the
farms—despite
the
fact
that
some
locals
,
especially
women
,
worked
there—was
designed
to
target
the
federal
government
for
excluding
locals
from
economic
activity
.
The
torch
of
protest
was
taken
up
by
the
northern-based
Amhara
in
July
this
year
,
with
land
again
being
the
immediate
issue
at
hand
.
The
Oromiya
example
emboldened
a
population
that
had
suffered
its
own
inequities
in
distribution
.
This
included
a
2012
controversy
over
the
government
claiming
large
chunks
of
land
from
the
Orthodox
Christian
monastery
of
Waldubba
for
sugar
cane
production
.
The
protests
this
year
were
sparked
by
the
arrest
of
a
committee
of
elders
that
wanted
the
government
to
redraw
the
state
boundary
and
return
land
to
Amhara
from
the
Tigray
Region
,
where
it
had
been
allocated
under
a
1996
administrative
reorganization
.
In
the
ensuing
confrontations
,
security
force
members
were
also
killed
.
On
the
weekend
of
August
6-7
,
renewed
protests
erupted
in
several
locations
and
about
a
hundred
demonstrators
were
shot
and
killed
.
No
efforts
to
mediate
were
undertaken
and
the
clashes
continued
.
Later
in
August
,
the
large
Esmeralda
flower
farm
near
Bahir
Dar
was
burned
to
the
ground
and
the
Dutch
owners
withdrew
from
Ethiopia
.
Other
unrest
followed
,
including
several
prisons
being
set
on
fire
.
Mass
strikes
followed
early
this
month
,
with
most
shops
and
businesses
in
urban
areas
of
Oromiya
and
Amhara
closing
.
The
wider
background
factors
of
the
protests
are
mounting
dissatisfaction
with
authoritarian
politics
,
interference
of
party
cadres
in
local
life
,
a
lack
of
government
accountability
and
proper
compensation
for
those
removed
from
land
,
the
dismantling
of
civil
society
organizations
over
the
last
decade
,
a
lack
of
political
and
civic
freedoms
,
and
a
dysfunctional
justice
system
.
The
revolts
have
notably
completely
bypassed
the
existing
opposition
parties—none
of
which
are
represented
in
Parliament—and
the
few
remaining
civil
society
organizations
in
the
country
.
Social
Settings
There
is
also
a
longer-term
social
dynamic
involved
in
the
crisis
:
Ethiopia
has
large
groups
of
unemployed
youth
and
there
is
still
a
significant
urban
underclass
that
is
often
excluded
from
high
school
or
vocational
education
and
jobs
.
New
cultural
and
political
youth
organizations
like
the
opposition
Blue
Party
,
Muslim
youth
groups
tied
to
the
Awoliya
School
,
Orthodox
Christian
associations
,
and
the
Zone
9
group
of
bloggers
have
been
treated
with
suspicion
and
surveillance
by
the
government
and
several
closed
down
.
Meanwhile
,
emerging
local
ethnic
elites
are
putting
forward
new
demands
for
more
local
autonomy
and
power
over
economic
decision-making
.
Paradoxically
,
their
emergence
and
assertiveness
has
been
made
possible
by
the
government’s
empowerment
of
ethnic
groups
since
1991
.
The
turmoil
in
Oromiya
and
Amhara
has
produced
a
momentum
of
protest
that
hasn’t
been
possible
among
smaller
ethnic
groups
in
the
south
of
Ethiopia
,
which
face
similar
land
and
injustice
problems
and
have
also
seen
casualties
.
The
ongoing
instability
might
have
serious
consequences
for
Ethiopia’s
socio-political
order
.
On
the
margins
of
the
revolt
are
radical
Muslim
groups
of
the
Wahhabist-Salafist
doctrine
and
some
are
even
rumored
to
have
taken
up
arms
to
combat
local
authorities
and
install
Islamist
rule
.
This
would
add
a
dimension
to
the
civil
unrest
absent
until
now
,
by
pitting
Muslims
against
Christians
.
Delaying
the
Inevitable
The
Ethiopian
government
has
pursued
a
partly
successful
development
agenda
in
recent
years
.
This
is
reflected
in
remarkable
growth
figures
,
prominent
new
infrastructure
,
strong
rates
of
poverty
reduction
,
good
grades
from
the
World
Bank
and
International
Monetary
Fund
,
and
praise
from
donor
countries
.
Yet
this
has
not
been
enough
to
satisfy
the
populace
.
It
again
proves
that
development
consists
not
only
of
economic
factors
but
an
overall
social
,
cultural
,
and
political
context
of
inclusiveness
and
opportunity
.
This
point
remains
poorly
understood
by
donors
to
African
countries
,
who
hope
for
democracy
,
civic
freedoms
,
and
other
outcomes
to
eventually
follow
their
development
aid
but
do
not
really
insist
on
it
and
provide
limited
options
to
impose
it
.
While
the
Ethiopian
protests
started
on
a
local
basis
,
they
have
now
taken
on
more
universal
ideals
of
political
freedom
,
social
justice
,
and
respect
for
rights
.
A
new
social
and
political
contract
is
needed
between
the
Ethiopian
state
and
society
.
Many
feel
that
the
expiry
date
of
the
current
regime
is
long
past
and
moving
toward
a
broader
transitional
government
might
be
the
answer
.
No
one
can
predict
the
country’s
future
,
but
a
scenario
similar
to
Burkina
Faso
in
2014—when
a
sustained
mass
uprising
ousted
the
regime
of
long-reigning
dictator
Blaise
Compaoré
—
seems
unlikely
.
There
is
little
chance
that
the
current
regime
will
pursue
a
rational
course
or
have
the
political
imagination
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
people
,
even
if
it
seems
an
inevitable
outcome
at
some
point
,
and
one
for
which
the
constitutional
framework
is
already
in
place
.
For
now
,
most
observers
except
the
restoration
of
public
order
to
entail
a
show
of
government
force
aimed
at
dividing
the
protest
movement
.
The
result
here
would
merely
be
resetting
the
cycle
of
social
unrest
.

Ethiopia
:
Cholera
Outbreak
Threat
in
Addis
Melese
Kebede
was
rushing
to
get
his
wife
timely
treatment
when
Fortune
met
him
in
the
early
hours
of
Wednesday
,
July
6
,
2016
.
She
was
in
a
critical
health
condition
;
horribly
weak
from
her
unstoppable
loss
of
fluid
through
vomiting
and
diarrhoea
.
He
was
incredibly
concerned
that
she
might
have
potentially
contracted
what
he
and
his
neighbours
had
been
discussing
throughout
the
week
.
Prior
to
her
case
,
health
workers
had
visited
their
locality
to
inform
residents
of
the
emerging
health
concerns
and
recommended
precautions
to
avoid
contamination
.
This
could
,
however
,
not
save
his
wife
from
infection
.
To
his
dismay
,
the
first
health
post
sent
him
to
a
Cholera
Treatment
Centre
(
CTC
)
at
Mikililand
Health
Centre
.
Melese
and
his
wife
have
lived
in
the
Kolfe
Qeranio
district
,
Wereda
13
,
for
the
past
27
years
.
This
may
well
be
a
demanding
time
for
him
,
as
he
is
challenged
with
his
low
income
.
He
works
as
a
carpenter
,
with
no
permanent
income
.
He
was
referred
to
the
Mikililand
Health
Centre
-
where
the
first
Cholera
case
was
reported
on
July
6
,
2016
.
His
wife
,
Alemitu
Mehertu
,
65
,
was
rushed
to
the
centre
that
specialises
in
cases
of
her
kind
.
The
separate
CTC
is
split
off
from
the
rest
of
the
Health
Centre
,
in
order
to
ensure
that
cases
of
acute
watery
diarrhoea
(
AWD
)
do
not
lead
to
further
contamination
among
patients
and
staff
.
The
station
where
Melese's
wife
first
visited
,
which
is
a
public
health
station
,
was
too
late
to
discover
that
she
was
actually
affected
by
AWD
,
and
mistakenly
bedded
her
together
with
other
patients
with
completely
different
cases
.
Though
the
first
case
of
death
due
to
AWD
was
reported
on
July
2
,
2016
-
with
media
alarmed
by
the
case
,
despite
it
being
managed
by
the
government
-
the
incidences
have
continued
to
grow
.
This
is
what
led
to
the
station
talking
the
decision
to
have
a
separate
unit
to
treat
Cholera
cases
,
two
weeks
ago
.
A
tented
CTC
is
located
just
inside
the
health
station
,
where
it
is
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
compound
inside
.
Inhabited
by
close
to
half
a
million
people
,
the
Kolfe
Qeranio
district
has
three
health
centres
,
two
run
by
the
government
and
the
other
by
NGOs
.
There
are
also
over
80
private
clinics
at
different
levels
and
a
hospital
.
The
station
located
in
Wereda
13
is
public
owned
,
and
has
been
referring
patients
on
to
Mikililand
.
"
We
decided
to
refer
her
situation
of
AWD
,
as
it
is
a
common
synonym
of
Cholera
,"
said
an
expert
.
Cholera
is
an
infectious
disease
characterised
by
intense
vomiting
and
profuse
watery
diarrhoea
,
which
rapidly
leads
to
dehydration
and
often
death
.
It
is
caused
by
infection
with
the
bacteria
Vibrio-cholerae
,
which
may
be
transmitted
via
infected
faecal
matter
,
food
or
water
-
as
defined
by
medicine
nets
,
an
electronic
technical
dictionary
.
The
husband
agreed
that
her
situation
was
exactly
as
defined
above
.
By
the
time
they
get
to
the
Mickililand
,
her
situation
left
no
room
for
rechecking
.
She
was
close
to
being
unconscious
,
and
frighteningly
frail
.
The
health
officers
automatically
admitted
her
to
the
specialised
centre
.
In
Kolfe
Qeranio
there
are
two
specialised
CTCs
,
one
in
each
government-run
health
centre
.
These
are
among
the
24
centres
established
across
the
10
district
that
have
been
alerted
to
identify
cases
.
It
was
almost
one
month
since
the
Ministry
of
Health
(
MoH
)
reported
the
frequent
occurrence
of
cases
of
AWD
in
parts
of
the
capital
,
calling
for
a
precautionary
preventive
measures
from
the
public
.
By
that
time
,
25
cases
of
AWD
had
been
identified
across
the
city
.
These
statistics
have
now
leapt
up
to
a
little
over
2,000
.
It
was
never
referred
to
as
an
outbreak
in
an
official
manner
,
which
would
have
been
followed
by
an
emergency
medical
shipment
from
international
agencies
.
The
WHO
standard
defines
a
Cholera
outbreak
when
10
to
20
cases
are
reported
and
confirmed
.
Two
weeks
after
the
alarm
,
sectoral
engagements
with
other
players
,
like
the
media
,
continued
,
indicating
that
the
situation
is
getting
no
better
,
but
demands
a
more
concerted
effort
.
"
Communication
and
framing
was
careful
not
to
alarm
the
public
,
mellowing
down
the
incidences
arising
,
rather
than
announcing
a
full-fledged
outbreak
and
a
public
health
emergency
,"
a
health
expert
,
working
in
one
of
the
international
development
partners
on
the
areas
of
health
,
told
Fortune
.
The
city
has
already
established
a
command
post
to
oversee
the
effort
.
The
post
,
presided
by
Mayor
Diriba
Kuma
,
comprises
institutions
such
as
the
Addis
Abeba
Water
&amp;
Sewerage
Authority
,
code
enforcement
officers
a.k.a
Denb
askebari
and
the
Police
.
In
response
to
the
outbreak
of
acute
diarrhea
in
Addis
Abeba
,
the
city
administration's
Food
,
Drugs
&amp;
Health
Bureau
,
in
cooperation
with
other
bureaus
such
as
Culture
&amp;
Tourism
,
Trade
and
Health
bureaus
as
well
as
the
Police
Commission
and
rules
enforcement
office
,
has
shouts
down
114
business
establishments
,
in
addition
to
32
butcheries
and
five
private
clinics
.
A
volume
of
of
4,800Kg
food
stuff
,
4,500Kg
of
fish
and
8,000ltr
drinks
were
destroyed
.
Despite
the
efforts
,
numbers
are
continuing
to
follow
an
upward
trajectory
.
So
far
,
six
deaths
have
been
officially
confirmed
in
the
capital
.
The
number
of
cases
is
reported
to
be
as
high
as
a
thousand
plus
,
according
to
unconfirmed
sources
.
For
Melese
and
his
neighbours
,
having
an
upset
stomach
and
diarrhoea
is
not
an
issue
of
discussion
-
particularly
when
it
happens
with
their
kids
.
The
number
of
adults
and
the
issue
in
the
media
has
alarmed
them
.
In
2010
,
Kolfe
Qeranio
territory
was
the
only
one
affected
by
officially
recognised
higher
indices
of
AWD
.
The
high
population
is
picked
as
the
first
factor
making
it
vulnerable
to
the
rainy
season's
floods
and
sewerage
outflow
.
A
shopkeeper
near
to
Mikililand
told
Fortune
that
most
who
visited
the
centre
with
similar
health
concerns
came
from
areas
such
as
Ayer
Tena
and
Alem
Gena
,
rather
than
nearby
localities
.
The
station
,
in
addition
to
giving
basic
services
,
is
now
treating
AWD-affected
people
from
other
areas
.
The
first
confirmed
cases
of
AWD
were
reported
in
this
district
.
"
So
far
,
I
did
not
hear
of
anyone
affected
with
2AWD
from
our
blocks
,"
said
the
shopkeeper
.
"
Rather
they
came
from
far
away
."
The
outbreak
mostly
affected
two
districts
-
Kolfe
and
Addis
Ketema
.
The
latter
is
known
for
its
densely
settled
population
,
with
33,970
people
within
just
a
one-kilometre
square
radius
.
In
this
respect
,
the
outbreak
may
well
have
started
from
a
river
in
the
Kolfe
district
,
which
flows
way
down
to
southern
parts
of
the
capital
in
the
Aqaqi
Qality
district
.
In
June
13
,
2016
,
out
of
22
confirmed
cases
,
the
Addis
Ketema
and
Kolfe
districts
reported
five
each
,
while
the
rest
of
the
districts
reported
just
one
to
three
.
The
city
Health
Bureau
has
already
identified
26
weredas
that
are
considered
to
be
vulnerable
to
the
outbreak
across
10
districts
,
with
the
majority
located
in
Kolfe
.
The
same
report
by
the
WHO
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
exact
source
of
the
outbreak
having
not
been
identified
presents
a
challenge
.
"
We
are
not
going
to
disclose
latest
figures
on
the
outbreak
,
because
it
may
create
a
panic
among
the
public
,"
Mulugeta
Admassu
told
Fortune
.
The
Bureau
is
now
working
with
UN
agencies
,
who
are
assisting
the
efforts
by
supplying
medicines
and
expertise
.
Close
to
1,000
health
extension
workers
(
HEWs
)
are
said
to
have
been
distributed
across
the
city
.
Similar
cases
of
citywide
outbreak
occurred
back
in
2005
and
2007
.
To
curb
the
impacts
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
WHO
Cholera
Guideline
is
to
be
implemented
.
Those
who
are
suspected
to
have
been
exposed
to
the
bacteria
that
causes
the
disease
have
to
be
treated
with
chemicals
used
for
this
purpose
.
Not
only
that
,
the
guideline
insisted
that
all
materials
have
to
be
disinfected
.
In
Melese's
case
,
he
missed
out
on
being
cleaned
with
a
chemical
after
he
brought
his
wife
to
the
first
station
.
"
We
didn't
know
that
his
wife's
case
was
AWD
,"
said
the
health
officer
.
After
almost
three
days
,
he
was
ordered
by
physicians
at
the
CTC
to
take
his
wife
back
.
"
They
said
,
she
is
now
in
a
better
condition
,
but
still
her
resistance
is
not
good
,"
said
Melese
.
"
They
also
told
me
that
the
fact
that
newly
affected
individuals
are
coming
to
the
centre
might
affect
those
already
recovered
."
Later
,
he
was
preparing
to
take
his
wife
back
home
,
but
her
illness
resurfaced
and
now
she
is
in
intensive
care
at
the
CTC
.
When
his
wife's
case
was
confirmed
,
it
was
the
first
,
but
now
other
new
cases
have
emerged
within
two
days
.
One
,
he
said
,
was
someone
who
lives
just
a
few
metres
from
his
house
.
In
the
CTC
,
where
his
wife
being
treated
,
he
has
witnessed
close
to
a
dozen
patients
with
the
same
sickness
being
treated
.
This
doesn't
include
additional
patients
in
another
part
of
the
CTC
,
who
are
at
different
stages
of
treatment
.
As
part
of
its
programme
to
inform
the
public
,
one
million
brochures
are
being
distributed
,
400
forums
were
prepared
and
close
to
1,000
individuals
from
religious
institutions
and
five-in-one
cells
were
consulted
.
"
Given
the
continuous
rainy
season
,
numbers
may
escalate
,"
said
Mulugeta
.
In
January
of
this
year
,
the
WHO
reported
that
heavy
rains
caused
by
El
Nino
will
cause
flooding
in
East
Africa
,
with
an
associated
health
risk
.
Back
then
,
a
Cholera
epidemic
with
more
than
12,000
cases
was
reported
in
Tanzania
.
The
report
also
indicated
that
it
may
spread
,
and
other
countries
will
experience
disease
outbreaks
.
The
Tanzanian
Cholera
outbreak
was
the
largest
since
1997-1998
,
which
had
over
40
000
reported
cases
.
The
outbreak
has
also
been
reported
in
border
towns
of
Eritrea
and
Ethiopia
.
What
do
Oromo
protests
mean
for
Ethiopian
unity
?
As
protests
in
Ethiopia
over
the
rights
of
the
country's
Oromo
people
continue
,
Addis
Ababa-based
journalist
James
Jeffrey
considers
if
they
are
threatening
the
country's
unity
.
The
latest
round
of
bloody
protests
over
Oromo
rights
had
a
tragically
surreal
beginning
.
A
bus
filled
with
a
wedding
party
taking
the
bride
to
the
groom's
home
was
stopped
at
a
routine
checkpoint
on
12
February
near
the
southern
Ethiopian
town
of
Shashamane
.
Local
police
told
revellers
to
turn
off
the
nationalistic
Oromo
music
playing
.
They
refused
and
the
bus
drove
off
.
The
situation
then
rapidly
escalated
and
reports
indicate
at
least
one
person
died
and
three
others
were
injured
after
police
fired
shots
.
The
exact
details
of
the
incident
are
hard
to
verify
,
but
what
is
clear
is
that
days
of
protest
followed
,
including
armed
local
militia
clashing
with
federal
police
,
leaving
seven
policemen
dead
,
the
government
says
.
Oromia
at
a
glance
:
Oromia
is
Ethiopia's
largest
region
,
surrounding
the
capital
,
Addis
Ababa
Oromo
are
Ethiopia's
biggest
ethnic
group
-
making
up
about
a
third
of
Ethiopia's
95
million
people
The
Oromo
Federalist
Congress
(
OFC
)
is
Oromia's
largest
legally
registered
political
party
,
but
holds
no
seats
in
parliament
Since
last
November
,
Ethiopia
has
seen
a
third
phase
of
the
recent
unrest
in
the
Oromia
region
which
has
been
unprecedented
in
its
longevity
and
geographical
spread
.
The
region
is
the
largest
in
Ethiopia
and
the
Oromos
,
who
make
up
a
third
of
the
population
,
are
the
biggest
of
the
country's
more
than
80
ethnic
groups
.
Initially
the
protests
were
in
reaction
to
a
plan
to
expand
the
administrative
border
of
the
capital
,
Addis
Ababa
,
which
is
encircled
by
Oromia
.
But
even
after
the
region's
governing
party
,
the
Oromo
People's
Democratic
Organisation
,
which
is
part
of
Ethiopia's
governing
coalition
,
shelved
the
plan
in
January
,
protests
have
continued
.
Historical
scars
"
There
is
a
strong
sense
of
victimhood
,
extending
back
150
years
,"
says
Daniel
Berhane
,
a
prominent
Addis
Ababa-based
political
blogger
,
covering
Ethiopia
for
the
website
Horn
Affairs
.
"
People
remember
the
history
.
The
scars
are
still
alive
,
such
as
how
the
Oromo
language
was
suppressed
until
20
years
ago
."
Despite
there
being
an
ethnic
basis
to
these
protests
,
observers
say
that
the
deeper
issues
behind
them
,
frustrations
over
land
ownership
,
corruption
,
political
and
economic
marginalisation
,
are
familiar
to
many
disenchanted
Ethiopians
.
The
government
has
disputed
the
numbers
given
for
those
killed
in
the
protests
by
rights
groups
The
numbers
killed
since
November
following
clashes
between
protesters
and
security
forces
given
by
international
rights
organisations
,
activists
and
observers
range
from
80
to
250
.
The
government
has
dismissed
various
death
tolls
as
exaggerations
,
and
said
that
a
recent
report
on
the
situation
by
the
New
York-based
Human
Rights
Watch
(
HRW
)
was
an
"
absolute
lie
".
'
Organised
gangs
'
Ethiopian
citizens
had
a
right
to
question
the
plan
to
expand
Addis
Ababa
,
but
the
protests
were
hijacked
by
people
looking
to
incite
violence
,
according
to
government
spokesman
Getachew
Reda
.
He
says
the
security
forces
have
faced
"
organised
armed
gangs
burning
down
buildings
belonging
to
private
citizens
,
along
with
government
installations
".
A
security
analyst
who
closely
watches
Ethiopia
says
"
there
could
be
radical
elements
and
factions
taking
advantage
,
but
you
cannot
define
a
movement
by
isolated
events
".
Despite
violent
incidents
,
the
protests
have
been
described
as
"
largely
peaceful
"
by
HRW
and
observers
in
Ethiopia
.
"
There
is
a
perception
of
lack
of
competence
in
governance
on
the
ground
,"
Mr
Daniel
says
.
"
There
were
easy
remedies
to
appease
initial
protests
,
it
was
not
hard
science
,
but
the
right
actions
were
not
taken
."
In
its
defence
,
the
government
says
it
heeded
the
call
of
the
people
when
it
came
to
concerns
over
the
Addis
Ababa
plan
,
and
observers
say
the
government
deserves
credit
for
withdrawing
it
.
Oromos
in
the
diaspora
have
taken
part
in
protests
in
solidarity
But
the
same
political
observers
add
that
the
government
must
allow
Ethiopians
to
exercise
their
constitutional
right
to
protest
,
and
handle
events
in
a
way
that
does
not
escalate
violence
.
The
government
has
said
that
the
protests
and
information
about
them
have
been
manipulated
by
foreign-based
opposition
groups
who
are
using
social
media
to
exaggerate
what
is
going
on
for
their
own
ends
.
"
The
diaspora
magnifies
news
of
what
is
happening
,
yes
,
but
no
matter
how
much
it
agitates
,
it
cannot
direct
[
what's
happening
]
at
village
level
in
Ethiopia
,"
says
Jawar
Mohammed
,
executive
director
of
one
of
those
accused
of
fomenting
conflict
,
US-based
broadcaster
Oromia
Media
Network
(
OMN
).
"
This
is
about
dissatisfaction
."
The
ruling
coalition
and
its
allies
won
every
single
seat
at
the
2015
election
Mr
Jawar
says
the
imprisonment
of
leaders
of
the
Oromo
Federalist
Congress
party
,
Oromia's
largest
legally
registered
opposition
political
party
,
along
with
thousands
of
other
Oromo
political
prisoners
,
makes
it
difficult
to
negotiate
a
lasting
solution
.
"
Also
what
is
the
UK
and
US
doing
?
As
major
donors
to
Ethiopia
they
should
be
taking
the
lead
to
get
the
government
to
work
out
an
agreement
."
This
is
a
long
way
from
the
heady
days
of
Ethiopia's
new
federal
constitution
after
the
overthrow
of
the
military
dictatorship
in
1991
.
That
introduced
a
decentralised
system
of
ethnic
federalism
,
but
this
jars
with
the
dominance
of
the
governing
Ethiopian
People's
Revolutionary
Democratic
Front
(
EPRDF
),
which
,
along
with
its
allies
,
holds
every
seat
in
parliament
.
Federal
tensions
"
The
ruling
government
is
a
victim
of
its
own
success
,"
the
security
analyst
says
.
The
Oromo
make
up
Ethiopia's
largest
ethnic
group
"
The
constitution
it
developed
made
promises
and
people
trusted
the
EPRDF
.
Now
people
are
demanding
those
rights
and
the
government
is
responding
with
bullets
and
violence
."
He
adds
that
the
government
has
expanded
basic
services
and
infrastructure
,
and
appears
to
respect
different
cultural
and
ethnic
identities
,
but
it
cannot
reconcile
this
with
its
more
authoritarian
decision-making
process
.
The
government's
hitherto
successful
job
of
holding
together
this
particularly
heterogeneous
federation
is
not
about
to
crumble
,
according
to
observers
here
.
But
things
may
get
worse
before
they
get
better
,
unless
underlying
sources
of
friction
and
frustration
are
addressed
.
Tigraians
victimized
in
their
own
motherland
Advertisements
Prelude
It
was
shocking
to
hear
and
watch
through
multiple
media
outlets
Tigraians
,
in
their
own
country
,
being
harassed
,
bitten
,
and
killed
in
cities
of
the
Amhara
Regional
State
of
Ethiopia
.
From
their
hideouts
in
Asmara
,
Eritrea
,
the
Birhanu
Nega
and
Co
.
group
,
a
declared
terrorist
organization
,
called
Ginbot-7
,
built
underground
network
of
flash-mob
hooligans
and
unleashed
genocidal
rampages
during
the
months
of
July
and
Augmet
2016
against
Tigraians
,
who
lived
for
generations
in
their
own
Motherland
,
Ethiopia’s
Amhara
Regional
State
.
For
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
Tigraians
,
hundreds
were
mobbed
and
massacred
;
their
properties
were
ransacked
and
torched
;
and
more
than
8,000
of
them
,
including
mothers
and
their
children
,
were
forced
to
escape
to
neighboring
North
Sudan
.
By
carrying
out
these
atrocities
,
Ginbot-7
and
its
sustainers
:
Shaébia
,
Egypt
,
and
some
other
Arab
countries
,
had
wished
for
tragic
civil
wars
throughout
Ethiopia
,
immersing
the
country
into
a
quagmire
of
a
failed
state
,
like
the
tragedies
of
Somalia
,
South
Sudan
,
Syria
,
Libya
,
Iraq
,
and
Afghanistan
,
and
,
subsequently
,
to
grab
political
power
.
Thanks
to
the
far
sightedness
of
the
Ethiopian
people
and
strength
of
the
Federal
security
apparatus
,
the
deliberate
provocations
of
the
enemies
of
Ethiopia
were
crashed
.
The
underground
mob
network
of
terror
they
built
was
destroyed
;
most
of
the
terrorists
were
captured
by
the
Ethiopian
security
forces
;
and
those
hiding
in
potholes
in
the
Amhara
State
and
those
who
escaped
to
their
Eritrean
hideouts
are
being
pursued
still
by
the
security
forces
of
Ethiopia
.
Specific
Cases
worth
Exploring
Immeasurable
Sacrifices
The
mob-lynching
crimes
against
Tigraians
in
their
own
country
must
be
condemned
in
strongest
terms
possible
.
These
historical
tragedies
will
be
recorded
in
history
books
.
They
are
ultimate
betrayals
of
the
Tigraian-patriotic
magnanimity
.
Bearing
the
burden
of
leading
role
responsibilities
,
the
people
of
Tigrai
sacrificed
nearly
hundred
thousand
of
their
young
daughters
and
sons
,
the
Tegadelti
heroines
and
heroes
,
during
the
17-year
bitter
struggle
to
free
all
Ethiopia’s
nations
,
nationalities
,
and
peoples
from
the
savagery
of
the
Derg-military
junta
.
The
final
victory
,
of
course
,
was
scored
in
collaboration
with
other
progressive
Ethiopian
forces
,
as
we
all
know
.
Mengistu
Hailemariam’s
Marxist-Leninist
junta
not
only
massacred
about
a
million
Ethiopians
,
it
also
destroyed
Ethiopia’s
social
,
economic
,
institutional
,
legal
,
and
political
infrastructures
.
Ethiopia
was
absolutely
ruined
.
What
did
Tigrai
get
for
bearing
the
heavy
burden
of
responsibilities
to
reconstruct
the
Modern
Ethiopian
State
?
Give
your
own
verdict
relative
to
what
happened
to
Tigraians
in
the
Amhara
State
.
Questionable
Governance
Where
was
the
Government
of
the
Amhara
Regional
State
,
while
Gondar
,
Bahir-Dar
,
and
their
environs
were
burning
?
This
Government
was
fully
aware
of
the
simmering
fire
of
social
unrest
that
was
ominously
starting
to
burn
in
the
Metema
area
,
where
unruly
chauvinist
elements
threatened
the
lives
of
Tigraians
and
ransacked
and
destroyed
their
properties
.
Was
the
Amhara
Government
an
accomplice
or
simply
it
was
an
inept
human
entity
or
an
incapacitated
,
failed
government
?
Clearly
,
a
governance
system
in
a
state
of
weakness
is
bound
to
go
down
to
fragility
from
where
it
goes
down
the
drain
to
the
state
of
absolute
failure
(
e.g
.,
Somalia
,
S
.
Sudan
,
and
Yemen
)
.
Precautionary
measures
before
weakness
sets
in
are
acts
of
an
effective
government
.
The
Amhara
Government
should
be
given
an
F
(=
failed
grade
)
by
all
measures
of
good
governance
.
History
Repeated
Itself
The
current
betrayal
of
the
Amhara
chauvinist
elements
is
a
reminder
of
the
historic
betrayal
of
Menelik
II
,
who
sabotaged
Yohannes
IV’s
military
strategies
to
fight
foreign
invaders
.
Emperor
Yohannes
demonstrated
his
patriotism
,
leadership
skills
,
and
military
prowess
against
all
Ethiopia’s
enemies
of
his
time
.
For
example
,
the
Ethiopian
forces
,
under
the
command
of
the
renowned
African
General
,
Raési
Alula
Aba-Nega
,
routed
well-equipped
Egyptians
,
led
by
European
and
American
mercenaries
,
in
the
following
battlefields
:
(
i
)
in
1875
at
Gundet
;
(
ii
)
in
1876
at
Guraé
;
(
iii
)
in
1880
at
Senhit
;
and
(
iv
)
in
1887
at
Aylet
.
Again
,
in
that
year
(
1887
),
just
after
Aylet
),
Alula
Aba-Nega
scored
a
decisive
victory
over
Italian
invaders
at
Dogali
.
The
Italians
called
their
humiliating
defeat
at
this
historic
battlefield
as
“
The
Dogali
Massacre
”
1
.
While
Emperor
Yohannes
was
fighting
all
these
wars
,
however
,
Menelik
was
making
secret
deals
with
the
Italians
and
other
enemies
of
Ethiopia
to
either
undermine
or
kill
Emperor
Yohannes
IV
.
Shortly
after
the
Dogali
debacle
,
the
Italians
agreed
in
a
secret
treaty
to
supply
Menelik
with
5,000
Remington
rifles
and
money
;
and
to
recognize
him
as
a
sovereign
power
in
return
for
his
promise
to
assist
Italy’s
colonial
expansion
.
Subsequently
,
between
1885
and
1895
,
a
total
of
189,000
weapons
were
delivered
to
Menelik
.
Emperor
Yohannes
IV
died
on
Mar
.
12
,
1889
at
Metema
,
in
today’s
Amhara
Killil
,
while
defending
his
beloved
country
against
the
Mahdists
of
Mahdi
Mohammed
Ahmed
of
Sudan
.
How
and
why
Emperor
Yohannes
IV
died
remains
a
historic
mystery
.
Who
fired
the
fateful
bullet
and
what
part
of
his
body
was
hit
remains
a
mystery
?
Many
writers
believe
that
Menelik’s
agents
under
the
auspices
the
Italians
killed
Emperor
Yohannes
,
the
King
of
Kings
.
The
degree
of
betrayal
and
greed
of
Menelik
for
political
power
at
any
cost
(
including
the
sale
and
dismemberment
of
Ethiopia
)
revealed
his
idiotic
mentality
and
greed
for
political
power
at
any
cost
.
As
if
he
was
to
live
for
eternity
,
immediately
after
the
death
of
Yohannes
IV
,
just
in
less
than
two
months
,
on
May
2
,
1889
,
Menelik
signed
the
Treaty
of
Wuchale
;
claimed
the
Ethiopian
Imperial
Throne
;
and
sold
Ethiopia’s
Red
Sea
frontier
,
Bahri-Negash
(
dismembered
the
Motherland
).
Then
,
the
buyers
,
the
Italians
,
named
Bahri
Negash
Eritrea
.
This
was
the
greatest
betrayal
in
Ethiopia’s
history
from
which
the
present
chauvinist
Amhara
and
Oromo
extremists
must
learn
;
and
beware
of
the
consequences
.
Betraying
own
Motherland
for
political
expediency
will
backfire
at
them
.
Ethiopians
have
learned
more
than
enough
lessons
of
subjugation
and
poverty
from
the
evil
deeds
of
Menelik
,
Haile
Selassie
,
and
Mengistu
Hailemariam
.
Self-serving
chauvinist
elements
of
the
Amhara
and
Oromo
ethnicity
,
who
have
become
messengers
of
Ethiopia’s
enemies
,
cannot
block
Ethiopia’s
pathways
to
a
complete
renaissance
under
the
modern
Federal
Democratic
Republic
governance
system
.
This
is
a
unique
governance
model
,
which
uniquely
fits
to
Ethiopia’s
sociocultural
,
economic
,
and
political
fabric
.
This
governance
model
has
started
to
respond
to
the
preferences
,
the
expectations
,
and
the
aspirations
of
Ethiopians
,
despite
the
human-induced
governance
challenges
.
Yes
,
a
lot
of
clean-up
(
administrative
purge
)
remains
to
be
done
to
foster
good
governance
.
Failure
to
Play
a
Proactive
Governance
Role
Tigrai’s
Regional
Government
indecisiveness
during
crises
and
peaceful
times
reveals
complete
lack
of
possession
of
the
set
of
skills
to
govern
effectively
and
efficiently
.
It
was
possible
to
avoid
the
above
tragedies
Tigraians
had
to
go
through
,
if
this
Regional
Government
had
taken
actions
against
the
ominous
signs
emanated
from
the
Amhara
Regional
State
sometime
in
April
and
May
(
2016
).
During
that
period
,
in
the
Metema
area
,
properties
of
Tigraians
were
destroyed
and
their
lives
were
threatened
.
The
victims
pleaded
to
all
administrative
and
security
agencies
of
the
Amhara
State
for
help
.
Because
they
were
denied
justice
,
they
took
a
long
and
expensive
journey
to
Addis
Ababa
to
plea
for
justice
.
The
world
heard
via
AigaForum
that
they
were
received
by
the
Minister
of
Federal
Affairs
,
Mr
.
Kasa
Teklebirhan
,
and
other
authorities
.
To
the
knowledge
of
many
of
us
,
the
case
of
these
poor
households
did
not
receive
a
just
resolution
.
Knowing
well
the
difficulties
these
Tigraian
victims
were
going
through
,
what
measure
did
the
Regional
Government
of
Tigrai
take
?
None
!
Thus
,
the
case
what
I
have
called
the
Metema
Fiasco
remains
in
limbo
.
This
means
that
the
Gondar
and
Bahir-Dar
tragedies
did
not
come
out
of
the
blue
.
There
were
enough
ominous
signs
that
required
immediate
and
decisive
political
actions
.
It
is
the
indecisiveness
of
the
Regional
Government
of
Tigrai
that
disheartened
Tigraians
most
.
This
is
a
government
that
violated
the
social
contract
it
entered
to
serve
citizens
to
the
fullest
possible
.
Strategic
Patience
and
Perseverance
Paid-off
In
contrast
to
the
failure
of
their
government
to
play
proactive
roles
,
the
people
of
Tigrai’s
patience
,
farsightedness
,
and
perseverance
are
admirable
.
They
did
not
rise
up
in
anger
instantaneously
to
retaliate
.
Their
history
teaches
us
all
that
they
know
very
well
when
to
hit
back
and
when
not
to
do
so
.
The
people
of
Tigrai
understood
very
well
that
the
above
highlighted
tragedies
in
the
Amhara
region
were
provocations
of
the
extremists
who
wished
for
nationwide
social
upheavals
and
eventual
downfall
of
the
current
government
.
The
doomsayers
(
disaster
wishers
),
who
are
the
narrow
minded
chauvinist
Amhara
and
Oromo
ethnic
extremists
,
failed
miserably
thanks
to
the
Tigraian
culture
of
bravery
and
cool
headedness
.
As
they
say
,
taking
high
moral
ground
pays-off
more
than
retaliatory
immediate
reactions
.
Thus
,
Tigraian
patriotism
remains
intact
;
Ethiopia
is
in
peace
(
business
as
usual
);
and
the
wishes
of
all
Ethiopia’s
enemies
,
such
as
Ginbot-7
,
Shaébia
,
and
some
of
the
Arab
countries
–
particularly
Egypt’s
–
were
dashed
;
and
their
next
moves
are
being
monitored
closely
.
The
Egyptians
are
advised
to
re-read
and
learn
lessons
from
the
humiliating
defeats
their
forefathers
were
subjected
to
at
the
battlefields
of
:
Gundet
,
Guraé
,
Senhi
t
,
and
Aylet
in
the
hands
of
Raési
Alula
Aba-Nega
(
highlighted
above
).
Historic
Solidarity
Messages
All
Tigraians
are
grateful
to
the
peoples
and
governments
of
Afar
,
Dredawa
,
Harrari
,
and
Somali
for
their
generous
financial
donations
in
support
of
the
internally
displaced
Tigraians
and
for
their
well-expressed
unwavering
solidarity
with
the
people
of
Tigrai
.
Peaceful
States
:
Some
Indicators
of
Good
Governance
For
the
civil
liberties
(
social
,
economic
,
legal
,
political
,
and
egalitarian
)
all
Ethiopians
are
enjoying
in
their
respective
administrative
territories
,
expressing
appreciation
and
admiration
to
the
following
regional
governments
and
peoples
is
warranted
:
Afar
,
Benishangul/Gumuz
,
Gambela
,
Harrari
,
and
Southern
Nations
,
Nationalities
and
Peoples
.
There
should
not
be
any
doubt
that
through
such
dedication
to
mutual
respect
and
cooperation
peace
and
prosperity
will
reign
throughout
the
Ethiopian
landscape
.
Compassion
and
Compatriotism
Last
,
but
not
least
,
the
people
of
Tigrai
are
grateful
to
the
ordinary
Amhara
people
(
the
masses
)
for
putting
the
dead
Tigraians
to
rest
;
for
sheltering
those
who
escaped
the
mob-lynching
in
safe
places
;
and
for
helping
those
who
were
able
to
escape
to
North
Sudan
.
These
acts
of
compassion
and
compatriotism
will
go
to
history
books
and
be
used
for
reconciliation
,
harmony
,
and
peaceful
coexistence
.
Way
Forward
:
a
Grassroots
Revolution
Its
own
frequent
statements
reveal
that
the
EPRDF
remains
immersed
in
a
dangerous
quagmire
of
corruption
.
This
governance
failure
violates
all
the
cardinal
rules
of
an
effective
political
governance
system
(
EPGS
).
Guiding
principles
EPGS
include
the
following
–
among
possible
others
:
(
i
)
personal
dedication
to
serve
own
people
with
honesty
,
personal
integrity
,
and
professionalism
;
(
ii
)
deliberative
and
participatory
decision
making
,
involving
all
stakeholders
;
(
iii
)
horizontally
and
vertically
integrated
,
coherent
,
policies
implemented
through
effective
institutional
configurations
;
(
iv
)
devolution
of
power
to
local
community-based
development
organizations
;
(
v
)
gender
equity
in
sharing
decision-making
power
;
(
vi
)
effectiveness
and
efficiency
in
allocating
scarce
resources
;
(
vii
)
strategic
vision
for
the
long-run
socioeconomic
and
political
outlook
;
(
viii
)
accountability
(
ability
to
demonstrate
and
explain
one’s
actions
);
(
ix
)
transparency
(
free
flow
of
information
)
in
all
operational
and
managerial
activities
;
(
x
)
responsiveness
to
society’s
preferences
,
aspirations
,
and
expectations
;
(
xi
)
equity
in
rights
,
obligations
,
benefits
,
and
costs
;
and
(
xii
)
primacy
of
the
rule-of-law
.
These
,
and
others
one
might
suggest
,
are
cardinal
rules
.
Collectively
,
they
form
a
sacrosanct
code
of
an
EPGS
.
Is
the
EPRDF
Government
ready
to
implement
these
and
their
supplementing
rules
?
By
coincidence
,
while
I
was
closing
this
piece
,
the
Government
declared
national
state
of
emergency
(
NSE
)
throughout
Ethiopia
for
a
6-month
period
.
This
is
a
serious
declaration
in
EPRDF’s
history
.
After
hearing
on
EBC
(
Ethiopian
Broadcasting
Corporation
)
PM
Hailemariam
Desalegn
declaring
the
NSE
,
yes
is
my
answer
to
the
question
,
because
,
in
my
view
,
the
following
and
much
more
conditions
for
an
EPGS
can
be
met
under
an
NSE
:
(
i
)
the
Declaration
empowers
the
Prime
Minister
and
his
Cabinet
to
take
sweeping
authoritative
measures
to
ensure
EPGS
;
(
ii
)
certain
public
and
private
organizations
will
be
off-limit
(
no
entry
);
(
iii
)
meetings
,
gatherings
,
and
rallies
will
be
banned
;
(
iv
)
political
purge
is
inevitable
;
(
v
)
security
agencies
will
not
need
the
conventional
authorization
from
a
judge
to
search
individuals
and
homes
;
(
vi
)
the
Cabinet
is
authorized
to
draft
a
decree
,
which
goes
to
the
Parliament
immediately
after
the
approval
of
the
President
,
for
Y
es
or
No
vote
to
be
implemented
within
a
short-time
,
depending
on
the
cases
expediency
;
and
(
vii
)
the
Constitutional
Court
will
be
stripped
its
main
functional
powers
for
the
period
of
the
NSE
.
One
only
hopes
for
the
success
of
the
NSE
in
forging
pathways
to
true
grassroots
revolution
and
thereby
to
genuine
sustainable
development
.

'
Foreign
firms
attacked
'
as
Ethiopia
protests
continue
Protesters
in
central
Ethiopia
have
attacked
foreign
businesses
,
according
to
the
owners
of
a
flower
firm
,
as
demonstrations
during
which
rights
groups
say
hundreds
of
protesters
have
been
killed
continued
.
The
Dutch
company
said
crowds
of
people
in
the
Oromia
and
Amhara
regions
torched
flower
farms
as
they
targeted
businesses
with
perceived
links
to
the
government
.
Flowers
are
one
of
the
country's
top
exports
.
The
Esmeralda
Farms
statement
came
after
weeks
of
escalating
protests
that
started
among
the
Oromo
,
Ethiopia's
biggest
ethnic
group
,
and
later
spread
to
the
Amhara
,
the
second
most
populous
group
.
Both
groups
of
protestors
are
demanding
more
political
and
economic
rights
,
and
say
that
a
ruling
coalition
is
dominated
by
the
Tigrayan
ethnic
group
,
which
makes
up
around
6
percent
of
the
population
.
According
to
the
New
York-based
Human
Rights
Watch
group
,
security
forces
have
killed
at
least
500
people
since
the
unrest
began
in
November
and
thousands
of
people
have
been
arrested
and
detained
.
The
government
has
denied
that
violence
from
the
security
forces
is
"
systemic
"
and
pledged
to
launch
an
independent
investigation
,
blaming
opposition
groups
inside
and
outside
of
the
country
and
what
it
called
"
anti-peace
"
elements
for
the
chaos
.
Esmeralda
Farms
said
its
10
million
euro
($11.1m)
investment
went
up
in
smoke
this
week
in
Bahir
Dar
city
and
that
several
other
horticulture
companies
were
also
affected
.

The
'
Ethiopia
rising
'
narrative
and
the
Oromo
protests
Remco
Bergkamp
,
assistant
manager
at
Esmeralda
Farms
in
the
Netherlands
,
told
Al
Jazeera
that
the
company
would
likely
leave
Ethiopia
,
rather
than
rebuild
the
farm
.
"
The
situation
is
not
stable
enough
to
run
a
business
.
You
just
don’t
know
where
the
country
is
headed
,"
Bergkamp
told
Al
Jazeera
.
Ethiopia
has
seen
sustained
economic
growth
in
recent
years
and
the
government
has
been
keen
to
attract
foreign
investors
,
often
offering
attractive
incentives
to
firms
who
want
to
do
business
there
.
Government
opponents
,
though
,
say
the
country's
poorest
have
seen
little
benefit
from
the
investment
.
"
The
government
sent
security
forces
to
protect
the
farm
.
Eventually
the
group
of
protesters
grew
so
large
that
the
soldiers
were
forced
to
flee
and
the
property
was
torched
,"
Bergkamp
said
.
"
One
of
our
Ethiopian
staff
members
was
wounded
in
the
attack
."
Protests
in
Oromia
started
in
November
last
year
when
the
government
announced
a
plan
to
expand
the
capital
-
a
city
state
-
into
the
surrounding
Oromia
region
.
Many
Oromos
saw
that
as
a
plan
to
remove
them
from
fertile
land
.
The
scheme
has
since
been
dropped
but
the
unrest
spread
as
demonstrators
called
for
the
release
of
prisoners
and
for
wider
freedoms
.
In
Amhara
,
demonstrations
began
over
the
status
of
a
district
-
Wolkait
-
that
was
once
part
of
Amhara
but
was
incorporated
into
the
neighbouring
Tigrayan
region
but
those
demonstrations
have
also
since
widened
.
The
governing
Ethiopian
Peoples
'
Revolutonary
Democratic
Front
last
month
rejected
a
United
Nations
request
that
it
send
in
observers
,
saying
it
alone
was
responsible
for
the
security
of
its
citizens
.
The
government
,
a
close
security
ally
of
the
West
,
is
often
accused
of
silencing
dissent
,
even
blocking
internet
access
at
times
.
At
elections
last
year
,
it
won
every
seat
in
the
country's
547-seat
parliament

Conflicts

floods
and

have
sparked
a
sharp
rise
in
the
number
of
people
going
hungry
in

in
drought-hit
Ethiopia
where
about
8.2
million
people

,
the
UN
has
warned
.
The
UN

said
on
Thursday
that
due
to
El

,
a

,
"
food

Omar

,
whose
sorghum
harvest
has
been
ruined
,
said
:
"
Every
plant
is
dead
.
We
have
nothing
now
."
The
farmer
said
that
the
well
in
his
village
dried
up
a
few
days
ago
because
many
people
from
surrounding
areas
had
no
choice
but
to
use
it
.
Struggling
to
feed
his
family
,
he
had
to
sell
one
of
his
three
cows
to
buy
enough
food
to
give
one
meal
a
day
to
his
children
.
"
We
have
nothing
to
eat
now
.
We
need
food
,
water
,"
Mohammed
said
,
adding
that
he
has
received
no
help
from
aid
agencies
or
the
Ethiopian
government
.
Cattle
herder
Mohammed
Fanni
said
40
of
his
cows
have
died
.
He
now
has
only
five
left
.
"
The
cattle
die
first
,"
he
told
Al
Jazeera
.
"
Now
as
the
drought
is
getting
worse
goats
and
camels
are
beginning
to
die
too
."
The
UN
said
about
8.2m
people
need
emergency
food
aid
in
Ethiopia
,
nearly
double
the
number
compared
to
six
months
ago
.
That
figure
could
rise
up
to
15
million
next
year
unless
the
international
community
stepped
up
with
donations
.
Approximately
$100m
have
been
given
by
international
donors
since
October
,
but
the
UN
said
they
could
need
at
least
five
times
that
much
in
the
next
few
months
.
'
Different
situation
'
The
Ethiopian
government
said
its
emergency
food
programme
is
helping
but
it
admitted
it
needs
urgent
assistance
.
Aid
agencies
told
Al
Jazeera
that
malnutrition
cases
in
the
area
were
rising
,
but
praised
the
government
for
what
they
said
was
its
crisis
management
and
fast
reallocation
of
budget
money
.

A
spokesman
for
the
ministry

in
the
capital
Addis
Ababa
told
Al

this
is
a
very
different
situation
to
the
1980s
,
when
a
drought
compounded
by
political
unrest
developed
into
a
famine
and
killed
more
than
a
million
people
.
"
The
government
is
trying
hard
to
save
the
lives
of
its
citizens
and
successfully
reallocating
money
from
its
budget
,"
Alemayehu
Berhanu
said
.
"
During
the
previous
drought
we
lost
a
lot
of
lives
and
animals
.
Now
,
because
of
government
action
and
progress
,
we
,
as
a
country
,
are
more
resilient
."
Floods
and
conflicts
While
some
countries
-
including
Ethiopia
,
Sudan
,
Eritrea
and
Djibouti
-
could
see
drier
conditions
,
other
nations
,
such
as
Kenya
,
Somalia
and
Uganda
are
at
risk
of
floods
.
More
than
90,000
people
in
war-torn
southern
Somalia
have
already
been
hit
by
weeks
of
severe
flooding
,
almost
half
of
them
forced
from
their
homes
,
the
UN
said
.
In
South
Sudan
,
where
a
nearly
two-year
long
civil
war
rumbles
on
,
about
40,000
people
are
already
starving
,
with
tens
of
thousands
more
on
the
brink
of
famine
,
the
UN
has
said
.
El

is
triggered
by
a

He

on
the
issues
behind
several
months
of
protests
by
Ethiopia's
largest
ethnic
group
,
the
Oromos
.
Around
100
people
died
following
clashes
with
security
forces
and
demonstrators
at
the
weekend
,
according
to
Amnesty
International
.

London
(
CNN)Ethiopia
is
facing
a
crisis
of
unprecedented
magnitude
,
yet
its
government
and
Western
enablers
refuse
to
acknowledge
and
recognize
the
depth
of
the
crisis
.
The
nationwide
protest
held
on
Saturday
by
the
Oromo
people
,
the
single
largest
ethnic
group
both
in
Ethiopia
and
the
Horn
of
Africa
,
is
clear
evidence
of
a
crisis
that
is
threatening
to
degenerate
into
a
full-scale
social
explosion
.
The
protests
are
the
most
unprecedented
and
absolutely
extraordinary
display
of
defiance
by
the
Oromo
people
and
it
is
by
far
the
most
significant
political
developments
in
the
country
since
the
death
of
Prime
Minister
Meles
Zenawi
,
the
strongman
who
ruled
the
country
for
over
two
decades
.
The
protests
took
place
in
more
than
200
towns
and
villages
across
Oromia
,
Ethiopia's
largest
region
,
and
were
attended
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
.
According
to
Oromia
media
Network
,
security
forces
used
live
bullets
against
peaceful
protestors
,
killing
over
100
protestors
.
Oromos
have
been
staging
protest
rallies
across
the
country
since
April
of
2014
against
systematic
marginalization
and
persecution
of
ethnic
Oromos
.
The
immediate
trigger
of
the
protest
was
a
development
plan
that
sought
to
expand
the
territorial
limits
of
Ethiopia's
capital
,
Addis
Ababa
,
into
neighbouring
Oromo
villages
and
towns
.
Oromos
saw
the
proposed
master
plan
as
a
blueprint
for
annexation
which
would
further
accelerate
the
eviction
of
Oromo
farmers
from
their
ancestral
lands
.
When
the
protest
resumed
in
November
of
2015
,
the
government
dismissed
the
protestors
as
anti-peace
elements
and
accused
them
of
acting
in
unison
with
terrorist
groups
--
a
common
tactic
used
by
the
government
to
crackdown
on
dissent
and
opposition
.
The
government
used
overwhelming
force
to
crush
the
protest
,
killing
hundreds
of
protestors
and
arresting
thousands
.
In
its
recent
report
titled
"
Such
a
Brutal
Crack
Down
",
Human
Rights
Watch
criticized
the
"
excessive
and
lethal
force
"
used
by
security
forces
against
"
largely
peaceful
protestors
"
and
puts
the
number
of
deaths
at
over
400
.
The
Oromo
make
up
well
over
a
third
of
Ethiopia's
100
million
people
.
Historically
,
Oromos
have
been
pushed
to
the
margin
of
the
country's
political
and
social
life
and
rendered
unworthy
of
respect
and
consideration
.
Oromo
culture
and
language
have
been
banned
and
their
identity
stigmatized
,
becoming
invisible
and
unnoticeable
within
mainstream
perspectives
.
Oromos
saw
themselves
as
parts
of
no
part
--
those
who
belong
to
the
country
but
have
no
say
in
it
,
those
who
can
speak
but
whose
voices
are
heard
as
a
noise
,
not
a
discourse
.
When
the
current
government
came
into
power
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
,
it
pursued
a
strategy
of
divide
and
rule
in
which
the
Oromos
and
Amharas
,
the
two
largest
ethnic
groups
in
the
country
,
are
presented
as
eternal
adversaries
.
Oromos
are
blamed
as
secessionists
to
justify
the
continued
monitoring
,
control
,
and
policing
of
Oromo
intellectuals
,
politicians
,
artists
and
activists
.
By
depicting
Oromo
demands
for
equal
representation
and
autonomy
as
extremist
and
exclusionary
,
it
tried
to
drive
a
wedge
between
them
and
other
ethnic
groups
,
particularly
the
Amharas
.
This
allowed
the
ruling
Ethiopian
People's
Revolutionary
Democratic
Front
and
Tigrayan
elites
to
present
themselves
as
the
only
political
movement
in
the
country
that
could
provide
the
stability
and
continuity
sought
by
regional
and
global
powers
with
vested
interest
in
the
region
.
Although
these
protests
are
triggered
by
more
recent
events
,
they
are
microcosms
[
of
]
a
more
enduring
and
deeper
crisis
of
political
representation
and
systematic
marginalization
suffered
by
the
Oromo
people
.
In
its
2015
comprehensive
country
report
titled
"
Because
I
am
Oromo
",
Amnesty
International
found
evidence
of
systematic
and
widespread
patterns
of
indiscriminate
and
disproportionate
attack
against
the
Oromo
simply
because
they
are
Oromos
.
This
led
administration
officials
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
create
fantasy
stories
which
cast
Ethiopia
as
democratic
and
its
leaders
as
progressive
.
In
2012
,
then
US
Ambassador
to
the
UN
,
Susan
Rice
,
described
Meles
Zenawi
,
the
architect
of
the
current
system
,
as
"
uncommonly
wise
"
and
someone
"
able
to
see
the
big
picture
and
the
long
game
,
even
when
others
would
allow
immediate
pressures
to
overwhelm
sound
judgment
."
In
2015
,
Undersecretary
of
State
for
Political
Affairs
Wendy
Sherman
praised
Ethiopia
as
"
a
democracy
that
is
moving
forward
in
an
election
that
we
expect
to
be
free
,
fair
,
credible
,
open
and
inclusive
."
She
further
added
,
""
Every
time
there
is
an
election
,
it
gets
better
and
better
."
That
election
ended
with
the
ruling
party
winning
100
%
of
the
seats
in
parliament
by
wiping
out
the
one
opposition
in
the
previous
parliament
.
In
2016
,
President
Obama
became
the
first
sitting
American
president
to
visit
Ethiopia
amid
widespread
opposition
by
human
rights
groups
.
Obama
doubled
down
on
previous
endorsements
by
administration
officials
by
describing
the
government
as
'
democratically-elected
."
However
,
consistent
reports
by
the
US
government
itself
and
other
human
rights
organizations
depict
an
image
of
a
police
state
whose
apparatus
of
surveillance
and
control
permeates
the
entire
society
down
to
household
levels
.
The
US
led
'
war
on
terror
',
started
by
President
George
Bush
,
provided
the
government
with
a
political
and
legal
instrument
with
which
the
government
justified
severe
restrictions
on
freedom
of
expression
,
assembly
,
and
association
.
The
2009
Anti-Terrorism
Proclamation
,
one
of
the
most
draconian
pieces
of
anti-terrorism
legislations
in
the
world
,
enabled
the
government
to
stretch
its
power
of
prosecution
and
punishment
beyond
what
is
permissible
under
standard
criminal
and
constitutional
law
rules
.
In
recent
years
,
terrorism
trials
have
become
the
most
significant
legal
instrument
frequently
used
by
the
authorities
to
secure
and
consolidate
the
prevailing
relationship
of
power
between
the
ruling
ethnic
Tigrayan
elites
and
other
ethnic
groups
in
the
country
.
Under
the
pretext
of
'
fighting
terrorism
',
the
regime
exiled
,
prosecuted
and
convicted
several
opposition
leaders
,
community
leaders
,
journalists
,
bloggers
,
and
activists
;
paralyzing
criticisms
of
any
type
.
In
its
2015
report
titled
Ethiopia's
Anti-Terrorism
Law
:
A
Tool
to
Stifle
Dissent
,
the
Oakland
Institute
details
the
ways
in
which
Ethiopian
authorities
systematically
appropriate
the
anti-terrorism
law
to
annihilate
dissent
and
opposition
to
the
policies
of
the
ruling
party
.
As
of
July
,
the
protests
have
been
spreading
into
the
Amhara
region
,
home
to
the
second
largest
ethnic
group
in
the
country
.
The
Amharas
and
Oromos
,
which
constitute
well
over
two-third
of
the
country's
population
,
are
seen
as
'
historical
antagonists
'.
The
ruling
party
transformed
this
antagonism
between
the
two
ethnic
groups
into
a
productive
political
tool
.
According
to
the
governing
narrative
,
Oromos
are
narrow-minded
and
exclusionary
people
who
seek
to
disintegrate
Ethiopia
into
smaller
republics
while
Amharas
are
chauvinists
who
seek
to
restore
the
old
feudal
order
,
leaving
the
ruling
party
as
the
only
political
force
that
can
rescue
Ethiopia
from
both
threats
.
These
governing
narratives
are
being
exposed
as
the
two
groups
begun
to
see
how
these
narratives
were
crafted
and
are
expressing
solidarity
towards
each
other
as
victims
of
the
same
system
.
The
Ethiopian
government
is
in
denial
and
making
the
same
promises
of
restoring
'
law
and
order
'
through
further
repression
and
crackdown
.
However
,
this
can
only
exacerbate
the
situation
and
throws
the
country
into
chaos
in
an
already
volatile
region
.

The
case
for

:
as
garlic
can
be
a
core
business
for
small
farms

Despite
the
fact
that
garlic
is
a
traditional
crop
for
Ukraine
in
the
middle
of
the
state
it
is
almost
grown
-
industrial
production
is
no
more
than
10
%
of
the
demand
.
According
to
official
statistics
in
Ukraine
imported
about
10
thousand
.
Tons
of
garlic
in
monetary
terms
is
about
$
8
million
annually
.
Why
Ukraine
loses
the
money
,
and
why
Ukrainian
farmers
can
make
more
money
on
the
garlic
,
Agravery.som
told
so-founder
LLC
«
UkrUP
»
Anna
Morozova
.
In
recent
years
,
we
import
more
garlic
from
China
rather
than
producing
within
the
state
.
Why
is
this
happening
?
-
Observing
this
,
we
decided
to
come
to
this
area
.
It
is
sad
when
one
of
the
symbols
of
Ukraine
,
we
can
not
grow
on
our
land
,
forced
to
invest
in
the
Chinese
economy
instead
of
his
own
.
The
complexities
in
this
area
is
much
smaller
than
prospects
.
Niche
still
empty
-
if
ten
years
,
our
state
has
been
in
the
top
ten
world
exporters
,
but
now
we
are
one
of
the
biggest
importers
of
this
culture
.
Accurate
statistics
on
the
Ukrainian
market
of
garlic
not
.
Approximately
90
%
of
garlic
that
we
eat
are
imported
to
us
from
abroad
.
The
rest
-
10
%
for
producers
(
3
%)
and
households
(
7
%).
Why
is
there
such
a
situation
?
-
We
have
experience
growing
-
problems
with
the
appropriate
planting
material
,
technology
.
Our
owners
do
not
know
when
to
cut
the
arrow
,
which
guard
and
dig
in
boxes
that
make
garlic
.
The
usual
wheat
and
corn
is
certainly
good
,
but
the
garlic
business
today
allows
you
to
earn
less
.
This
culture
requires
much
less
space
-
an
appropriate
level
of
profitability
could
be
starting
with
a
few
hundred
.
Large
agricultural
holdings
were
never
interested
her
-
to
sow
large
areas
(
hundreds
of
hectares
)
should
be
much
deeper
technological
know
moments
(
and
they
did
not
)
work
on
the
handling
,
storage
and
so
on
.
In
medium-sized
businesses
simply
do
not
come
to
hand
this
culture
-
not
massive
sales
within
the
country
.
Therefore
we
can
say
that
a
while
garlic
remained
unnoticed
by
farmers
.
The
best
scenario
for
the
further
development
of
garlic
industry
can
be
cooperation
.
Our
company
,
UkrUP
,
was
founded
in
2015
.
In
the
beginning
we
planned
to
create
a
company
that
grows
garlic
as
a
niche
culture
.
During
the
question
on
the
need
to
expand
and
create
a
so-called
cluster

I
want
to
emphasize
that
we
are

How
bad
is
the
drought
in
Ethiopia
?
Alarm
bells
are
ringing
for
a
food
emergency
in
Ethiopia
.
The
UN
says
15
million
people
will
need
help
over
the
coming
months
.
[
8
January
2016
:
Graphic
below
updated
to
include
November
and
December
satellite
imagery
].
The
government
,
wary
of
stigma
and
therefore
hesitant
to
ask
for
help
,
has
nevertheless
said
more
than
eight
million
Ethiopians
need
food
assistance
.
Extra
imports
to
stem
the
crisis
are
already
pegged
at
more
than
a
million
tonnes
of
grain
,
beyond
the
government’s
means
.
Inevitably
,
comment
and
media
coverage
compare
the
current
situation
with
1984
–
the
year
Ethiopia’s
notorious
famine
hit
the
headlines
.
Reports
suggest
this
is
the
worst
drought
in
30
years
.
One
declares
it
a
“
code
red
”
drought
.
So
how
bad
actually
is
it
?
The
country
of
close
to
100
million
people
is
huge
,
spread
over
an
area
of
more
than
a
million
square
kilometres
that
ranges
from
semi-desert
to
swamp
to
mountain
ranges
and
fertile
farmland
.
The
weather
systems
and
agricultural
patterns
are
diverse
and
complex
.
Even
within
the
higher-altitude
areas
of
the
country
,
the
most
densely
populated
,
the
typical
rainy
seasons
vary
and
crops
are
grown
at
different
times
of
the
year
.
This
year
,
the
weather
has
been
prone
to
even
greater
variation
due
to
the
global
climate
phenomenon
El
Niño
,
last
seen
in
1997-1998
.
Ethiopia
produces
more
than
90
percent
of
its
own
food
.
Last
year
,
the
cereal
harvest
was
estimated
to
be
23
million
tonnes
,
but
imports
in
recent
years
averaged
1.2
million
tonnes
–
just
five
percent
of
that
.
So
even
if
2015
and
2016
are
bad
years
(
the
impact
of
a
poor
harvest
is
felt
months
later
as
food
stocks
run
out
),
the
vast
majority
of
Ethiopian
people
will
support
themselves
and
eat
produce
from
their
own
country
.
But
in
a
giant
like
Ethiopia
,
15
percent
of
the
population
is
15
million
people
–
more
than
the
entire
humanitarian
caseload
of
the
Syrian
crisis
.
An
extra
five
percent
of
cereals
is
another
1.2
million
tonnes.The
costs
and
logistics
become
formidable
at
this
scale
.
Weather
The
weather
is
only
one
part
of
the
equation
in
whether
people
go
hungry
.
Politics
,
economics
,
the
availability
of
seeds
and
fertiliser
,
conflict
,
trade
and
labour
markets
,
population
pressure
,
social
habits
,
and
a
host
of
other
factors
matter
too
.
While
the
science
and
sociology
of
food
security
is
complex
and
layered
,
international
agencies
working
on
drought
and
hunger-prone
countries
,
including
Ethiopia
,
use
a
scheme
called
the
Integrated
Food
Security
and
Humanitarian
Phase
Classification
Framework
(
IPC
)
to
simplify
the
mass
of
underlying
data
into
a
five-step
scale
–
from
minimal
food
security
pressure
to
famine
.
Some
parts
of
northern
Ethiopia
are
already
flagged
as
being
in
“
Phase
4
”,
one
step
from
the
worst
category
.
More
are
expected
to
follow
,
unless
sufficient
resources
can
halt
the
slide
.
Even
getting
a
single
view
of
one
year’s
weather
,
let
alone
human
interaction
with
it
,
is
no
simple
matter
.
For
more
than
30
years
,
meteorologists
have
gathered
a
giant
archive
of
satellite
data
for
Ethiopia
.
US
satellites
,
in
particular
METOP-AVHRR
,
churn
out
petabytes
of
data
.
Triangulating
that
with
other
sources
,
including
ground-based
measurement
,
farm
assessments
,
nutrition
,
and
price
monitoring
provides
a
rich
toolkit
to
estimate
vegetation
,
rainfall
,
soil
moisture
and
temperature
–
ultimately
giving
an
idea
of
food
on
the
table
.
Considering
all
the
variables
,
the
drought
and
famine
watchdog
FEWS
NET
,
established
in
the
wake
of
the
1984
famine
,
has
used
direct
,
but
not
alarmist
,
language
to
describe
the
prospects
:
its
latest
report
for
Ethiopia
is
titled
“
Large-scale
food
security
emergency
projected
for
2016
”.
The
UN’s
Food
and
Agriculture
Organization
,
meanwhile
,
warned
:
“
food
security
conditions
sharply
deteriorated
.”
Political
sensitivity
,
donor
pressures
,
logistics
,
media
distortion
,
inefficiency
and
scepticism
may
yet
conspire
to
tip
more
Ethiopians
into
“
Phase
4
.”
Even
in
the
best-case
scenario
,
the
financial
resources
will
be
hard
to
find
–
$270m
is
still
needed
for
2015
alone
,
according
to
UN's
emergency
aid
coordination
body
,
OCHA
,
and
needs
are
set
to
rise
sharply
(
the
US
,
the
UK
and
China
have
pledged
relatively
early
to
the
response
,
according
to
the
government
).
To
illustrate
the
complexity
of
weather
patterns
in
Ethiopia
and
attempt
to
demonstrate
a
link
with
El
Niño
,
IRIN
analysed
30
years
of
satellite
imagery
to
provide
some
visual
evidence
of
the
complex
and
erratic
picture
of
weather
in
the
Horn
of
Africa
.

This
set
of
maps
and

from
FEWS
NET
(
see
here
for
details
)
highlights
the
range
of
factors
that
go
into
analysing
food
security
.
The
first
shows
that
localised
areas
in
eastern
and
northern
Ethiopia
are
as
dry
as
they
have
been
for
30
years
–
the
source
of
the
"
worst
in
30
years
"
statements
.
Looking
for
El
Niño
Because
El
Niño
has
different
effects
across
the
Horn
of
Africa
,
the
correlation
between
poor
vegetation
in
Ethiopia
and
the
Pacific
sea
temperature
is
not
strong
when
looking
at
the
whole
country
.
Ethiopia
straddles
areas
affected
both
by
dry
and
wet
variations
,
as
this
FAO
map
shows
:
Below
,
we
compare
the
levels
of
poorer-than-normal
vegetation
with
the
temperature
changes
of
the
Pacific
Ocean
-
the
clues
to
the
El
Niño
Southern
Oscillation
.
The
next
graph
checks
the
values
in
eastern
Ethiopia
,
the
worst-affected
area
this
year
,
by
zooming
in
to
this
box
,
with
the
Djibouti
border
in
the
east
and
Lake
Tana
in
the
west
.
While
the
severity
of
the
current
drought
seems
on
a
par
with
previous
events
,
to
the
untrained
eye
it
is
neither
record-breaking
nor
is
a
correlation
with
El
Niño
so
far
apparent
.
However
,
the
Ethiopian
Meteorological
Agency
is
forecasting
wet
weather
for
the
rest
of
2015
,
which
might
appear
to
match
the
1997
experience
(
see
the
rich
greens
of
late
1997
in
the
graphic
above
).
The
peak
of
the
increase
in
Pacific
temperature
was
around
December
1997
.
The
cooling
part
of
the

,
La
Niña
,
follows

Ethiopia
:
The
Human
Cost
of
Ethiopia's
Sweeping
State
of
Emergency
-
'
I
Never
Wanted
to
See
Tomorrow
'
On
Saturday
Dec
.
17
,
Siraj
Fegessa
,
Ethiopia's
minister
of
defense
and
the
secretariat
of
the
command
post
tasked
to
implement
the
country's
sweeping
six-month
state
of
emergency
(
SOE
),
had
news
that
should
have
come
as
a
relief
to
tens
of
thousands
of
Ethiopians
.
Minister
Siraj
,
a
civilian
,
told
journalists
mostly
drawn
from
state-controlled
and
state-affiliated
media
houses
that
some
9
,
800
individuals
who
were
detained
under
the
SoE
will
be
released
by
Wednesday
Dec
.
21
while
2
,
449
others
"
will
be
brought
to
justice
."
But
the
mood
among
Ethiopians
following
the
announcement
is
not
that
of
a
celebration
;
for
many
,
the
damage
their
loved
ones
have
sustained
while
held
at
one
of
the
half
dozen
detention
facilities
(
referred
to
by
many
as
'
concentration
camps
')
is
too
deep
to
have
been
undone
by
the
announcement
of
their
release
,
and
rightly
so
.
By
the
government's
account
,
a
total
of
24,799
individuals
were
arrested
in
two
rounds
under
the
SoE
since
October
this
year
.
However
,
this
figure
doesn't
mention
whether
those
who
were
detained
prior
to
the
decreeing
of
the
SoE
on
October
9
are
accounted
for
.
And
,
informed
by
previous
brutalities
of
the
security
apparatus
,
Ethiopians
are
under
no
illusion
that
this
figure
is
much
higher
than
what's
being
admitted
by
the
government
.
Even
one
is
to
take
the
government's
figures
to
account
,
it
simply
means
that
thousands
of
university
students
have
missed
this
academic
year's
attendance
;
thousands
others
who
were
the
breadwinners
of
their
families
and
extended
family
members
have
failed
to
deliver
on
their
promises
;
and
thousands
have
lost
their
jobs
.
But
for
some
,
the
cost
is
too
personal
to
recover
from
.
One
such
Ethiopian
is
Alemayehu
Merga
,
(
name
changed
upon
request
),
a
former
clerk
at
a
private
Bank
in
Awash
town
some
91
km
south
east
of
the
capital
Addis
Abeba
.
In
a
letter
sent
to
Addis
Standard
a
few
weeks
ago
,
Alemayehu
says
when
he
was
arrested
from
his
hotel
room
(
name
of
the
hotel
withheld
)
in
Merkato
,
an
open
market
hailed
as
the
largest
in
Africa
,
he
was
preparing
for
his
wedding
scheduled
to
take
place
on
Sunday
September
16
in
Adama
,
100k
south
east
of
Addis
Abeba
.
The
intense
crackdown
by
the
police
that
led
to
Alemayehu's
arrest
followed
a
massive
anti-government
protest
on
August
06
,
2016
.
The
weekend
protest
was
called
by
online
activists
of
the
#OromoProtest
and
was
dubbed
"
Grand
Oromo
Rally
".
It
ended
when
regional
and
federal
police
have
brutally
suppressed
the
protesters
,
killing
hundreds
and
detaining
thousands
.
But
instead
of
receding
,
thousands
more
of
protesters
raged
through
the
Special
Zone
of
the
Oromia
Regional
State
,
eight
neighboring
towns
mostly
located
within
25k
radius
from
the
capital
Addis
Abeba
.
The
bedrock
of
these
protests
was
a
10
month
persistent
anti-government
protest
that
began
in
Oromia
regional
state
,
the
largest
regional
states
in
federated
Ethiopia
,
in
November
2015
;
it
was
followed
,
several
months
later
,
by
another
anti-government
protest
in
Amhara
regional
state
in
the
north
.
The
protests
in
these
two
regional
states
have
quickly
escalated
into
a
large
scale
anti-government
protest
that
posed
the
ultimate
challenge
to
the
hitherto
unchallenged
quarter
century
reign
of
the
ruling
TPLF-dominated
EPRDF
regime
in
Ethiopia
.
A
pre-wedding
trip
gone
dreadful
Almayehu's
arrest
happened
at
a
time
when
,
reeling
from
uncontrollable
protest
flare
ups
in
most
parts
of
the
country
,
the
federal
and
city
police
began
conducting
random
stop
and
search
and
have
arrested
unknown
numbers
of
individuals
from
the
city
.
Low-cost
hotels
throughout
Addis
Abeba
have
also
received
letters
from
their
respective
Kebele
administrations
ordering
them
to
declare
the
identities
of
their
guests
who
come
from
the
countryside
.
"
I
came
to
Addis
Abeba
from
Awash
to
buy
some
household
materials
and
pick
my
wedding
suit
which
was
ready
at
a
tailor's
shop
in
Piassa
.
But
I
was
arrested
on
September
10
,"
his
letter
narrates
.
Alemayehu
was
then
held
at
a
police
station
commonly
known
in
Addis
Abeba
as
"
Sidistegna
"
Police
station
located
in
the
heart
of
the
city
.
He
was
kept
there
incommunicado
for
about
a
month
.
No
one
from
his
family
knew
what
happened
to
him
.
And
he
missed
his
wedding
.
"
I
kept
telling
the
police
officers
that
I
was
only
in
town
to
prepare
for
my
wedding
,
but
they
kept
telling
me
I
was
in
town
to
organize
young
people
to
protest
.
I
had
a
few
invitation
cards
that
I
was
planning
to
give
out
to
my
friends
and
relatives
living
in
the
city
.
I
never
managed
to
give
them
as
I
was
arrested
the
very
next
day
after
I
arrived
in
the
city
.
And
even
if
I
kept
showing
my
wedding
invitation
cards
to
the
police
officers
,
no
one
wanted
to
believe
me
."
Alemayehu
joined
hundreds
of
others
detained
under
similar
circumstances
.
Most
of
them
are
young
Ethiopians
and
all
of
them
were
held
incommunicado
at
several
police
stations
in
the
city
.
On
October
02
,
the
unthinkable
happened
when
police
fired
shots
at
a
gathering
of
millions
of
Oromo
who
came
to
celebrate
the
annual
Ireechaa
festival
in
Bishoftu
town
,
40
km
south
of
the
capital
.
For
many
,
the
death
by
stamped
of
yet
unverified
numbers
of
Ethiopians
at
this
sacred
,
otherwise
peaceful
festival
was
the
turning
point
of
the
almost
year-long
anti-government
protests
that
gripped
the
nation
.
A
'
five-day
rage
'
was
called
by
online
activists
of
the
Oromo
protests
following
what
was
quickly
hashtaged
as
"
IreechaaMassacre
.
It
resulted
in
protesters
attacking
foreign
owned
businesses
in
several
parts
of
the
country
.
It
also
led
to
the
near
collapse
of
the
country's
tourism
industry
,
forced
the
government
to
declare
the
current
SoE
and
to
reshuffle
the
Prime
Minister's
cabinet
only
a
year
after
it
was
sworn
in
to
the
office
.
But
for
Alemayehu
and
thousands
of
others
detained
pre
and
post
the
SoE
,
the
ordeal
has
just
began
.
Three
days
after
the
decreeing
on
Oct
.
9
of
the
sweeping
SoE
,
which
practically
suspended
most
parts
of
the
constitution
,
Alemayehu
and
"
roughly
2000
others
"
held
in
police
stations
in
Addis
Abeba
were
transported
to
Awash
Abra
Military
camp
,
not
far
away
from
Alemayehu's
birth
place
in
Awash
.
The
military
camp
is
one
of
the
dozen
camps
throughout
the
country
where
tens
of
thousands
of
Ethiopians
detained
under
the
SoE
are
currently
held
.
The
2013
country
report
by
the
US
Bureau
of
Democracy
,
Human
Rights
,
and
Labor
describes
these
camps
as
"
unofficial
detention
centers
throughout
the
country
,
including
in
Dedessa
,
Bir
Sheleko
,
Tolay
,
Hormat
,
Blate
,
Tatek
,
Jijiga
,
Holeta
,
and
Senkele
.
Most
were
located
at
military
camps
."
"
None
of
my
family
members
,
including
my
bride-to-be
,
knew
I
was
there
,"
Alemayehu's
3-pages
letter
recounts
.
All
of
them
were
told
they
were
arrested
by
the
"
orders
of
the
command
post
",
after
they
were
transported
to
the
camp
.
By
now
,
the
government
announced
that
the
command
post
was
led
by
defense
minister
Siraj
and
was
comprised
of
other
unnamed
senior
officials
.
"
Hell
breaks
loose
"
"
Once
inside
the
military
camp
,
we
were
told
we
would
undergo
an
ideological
training
on
the
current
federal
arrangement
and
we
will
be
taught
about
the
illegalities
of
the
protests
."
According
to
Alemayehu's
letter
,
in
the
beginning
,
there
were
about
3,000
detains
who
came
from
the
Oromia
regional
state
.
"
But
after
a
week
,
and
the
weeks
that
followed
our
numbers
grew
,
in
my
estimate
,
to
about
6000
.
We
were
told
we
would
only
be
there
for
two
weeks
'
training
and
be
released
afterwards
."
Describing
the
situation
inside
the
military
camp
,
Alemayehu
wrote
:
"
It
was
the
moment
I
experienced
how
hell
breaks
loose
."
"
The
heat
is
unbearable
during
day
time
,
and
at
night
the
temperature
drops
to
a
freezing
cold
.
There
was
only
one
meal
a
day
(
often
bread
)
and
the
temporary
corrugated
iron
shacks
we
were
held
inside
had
no
running
water
,
no
toilets
no
sleeping
places
.
Sometime
in
mid-October
what
looked
like
a
cholera
outbreak
spread
.
We
have
seen
many
dead
bodies
being
transferred
out
of
the
camp
at
night
times
."
"
I
never
wanted
to
see
tomorrow
"
The
said
training
didn't
begin
during
the
first
week
,
Alemayehu's
letter
further
said
,
"
but
every
night
dozens
of
us
would
be
called
for
investigations
.
I
was
lucky
to
not
have
been
called
for
the

but
many
of
those
who
did
often
come
back
limping
after
being
tortured
beyond
words
."
When
the
training
began
,
it
involved
hours-long
lectures
given
mostly
by
military
officials
on
the
legacy
the
late
Prime
Minister
Meles
Zenawi
,
the
history
of
the
party
he
co-founded
,
TPLF
,
and
the
17
years
sacrifices
its
members
had
paid
to
overthrow
the
military
Derg
in
1991
.
It
also
included
the
ruling
party's
economic
ideology
of
building
a
developmental
state
,
the
concept
of
federalism
and
multi-party
democracy
,
according
to
the
letter
.
"
But
most
of
the
time
,
we
would
just
sit
there
in
the
blazing
sun
,
hungry
and
thirsty
,
waiting
for
the
officials
to
arrive
.
Sometimes
,
nobody
shows
up
and
we
would
be
told
to
return
to
the
barracks
and
come
back
tomorrow
morning
.
But
I
never
wanted
to
see
tomorrow
.
All
I
wanted
was
to
die
and
end
my
misery
."
Two
weeks
into
his
ordeal
at
the
military
camp
,
Almayehu
was
released
after
a
"
police
officer
who
knew
who
I
was
and
what
I
did
for
living
in
Awash
spotted
me
there
."
"
After
what
I
think
was
this
police
officer's
attempt
to
help
me
,
I
was
called
one
morning
and
told
to
pack
up
and
be
ready
.
There
will
be
a
car
ready
to
transport
me
to
Adama
.
That
was
it
;
no
one
to
ask
for
justice
;
no
one
to
ask
for
a
letter
to
my
employees
,
nothing
."
Alemayehu
is
back
in
Awash
,
from
where
he
e-mailed
us
his
letter
.
He
is
unemployed
after
the
bank
he
was
working
for
refused
to
take
him
back
on
"
administrative
grounds
.
I
am
now
looking
for
a
job
."
And
he
has
since
learned
the
devastating
news
of
the
disappearance
of
his
fiancé
.
"
Like
me
,
no
one
knows
where
she
is
at
now
.
I
was
told
that
after
my
mysterious
disappearance
she
was
struggling
to
face
the
possibilities
that
I
may
have
simply
deserted
her
.
The
last
time
she
was
seen
in
the
town
,
where
she
was
living
with
family
members
,
was
on
Oct
.
13
,
after
that
she
has
simply
vanished
;
it
is
like
she
never
existed
."
Alemayehu's
story
of
families
torn
apart
and
the
hopelessness
that
follows
resonates
with
hundreds
and
thousands
of
others
who
have
been
detained
and
still
remain
in
one
of
the
seven
temporary
detention
facilities
throughout
the
country
.
A
brief
report
released
yesterday
by
the
Ethiopia
Human
Right
Project
sampled
24
individuals
,
mainly
opposition
party
members
,
bloggers
,
and
journalists
,
who
are
currently
detained
under
the
SoE
.
The
three
salient
circumstances
all
the
24
detainees
share
in
common
are
,
according
to
the
report
:
almost
all
remained
detained
without
due
court
process
;
some
have
been
informed
of
the
reasons
for
their
arrests
after
they
were
taken
to
the
detention
facilities
;
and
some
have
not
even
been
informed
of
the
reason
for
their
detention
.
By
all
accounts
,
it
is
a
story
of
the
human
cost
in
a
country
under
a
sweeping
State
of
Emergency
;
a
country
where
the
news
of
the
release
of
thousands
would
come
too
little
too
late
to
restore
the
hopes
that
were
dashed
,
for
some
,
forever
.
Ethiopia
declares
state
of
emergency
over
protests
Ethiopia
has
declared
a
state
of
emergency
following
months
of
often
violent
anti-government
protests
,
especially
in
the
restive
Oromia
region
.
"
A
state
of
emergency
has
been
declared
because
the
situation
posed
a
threat
against
the
people
of
the
country
,"
Ethiopian
Prime
Minister
Hailemariam
Desalegn
said
on
state-run
television
on
Sunday
.
Local
media
said
the
state
of
emergency
,
declared
for
the
first
time
in
25
years
,
will
last
for
six
months
.
What
is
triggering
Ethiopia's
unrest
?
Earlier
on
Sunday
,
the
state
Ethiopian
Broadcasting
Corporation
reported
that
the
state
of
emergency
was
effective
as
of
Saturday
evening
as
a
means
to
"
deal
with
anti-peace
elements
that
have
allied
with
foreign
forces
and
are
jeopardising
the
peace
and
security
of
the
country
".
It
added
that
that
the
Council
of
Ministers
discussed
the
damage
by
the
protests
across
the
country
and
declared
the
state
of
emergency
in
a
message
delivered
to
Hailemariam
.
Protests
reignited
this
week
in
the
Oromia
region
-
the
main
focus
of
a
recent
wave
of
demonstrations
-
after
dozens
of
people
were
killed
in
a
stampede
on
October
2
,
which
was
sparked
by
police
firing
tear
gas
and
warning
shots
at
a
huge
crowd
of
protesters
attending
a
religious
festival
.
The
official
death
toll
given
by
the
government
was
55
,
though
opposition
activists
and
rights
groups
said
they
believe
more
than
100
people
died
as
they
fled
security
forces
,
falling
into
ditches
that
dotted
the
area
.
According
to
government
officials
,
factories
,
company
premises
and
vehicles
were
burnt
out
completely
or
damaged
during
the
rioting
.
Many
roads
leading
to
the
capital
,
Addis
Ababa
,
were
reported
to
be
blocked
.
Ethiopia's
government
,
a
close
ally
of
the
West
,
has
often
been
accused
of
stifling
criticism
by
arresting
and
detaining
thousands
of
people
.
According
to
the
New
York-based
Human
Rights
Watch
group
,
at
least
500
people
have
been
killed
by
security
forces
since
anti-government
protests
began
in
November
.
The
government
has
denied
that
violence
from
the
security
forces
is
systemic
,
and
in
August
,
rejected
a
United
Nations
request
to
send
in
observers
,
saying
it
alone
was
responsible
for
the
security
of
its
citizens
.
Months
of
protests
The
anti-government
demonstrations
started
in
November
among
the
Oromo
,
Ethiopia's
biggest
ethnic
group
,
and
later
spread
to
the
Amhara
,
the
second
most
populous
group
.
Though
they
initially
began
over
land
rights
,
they
later
broadened
into
calls
for
more
political
,
economic
and
cultural
rights
.
Both
groups
say
that
a
multi-ethnic
ruling
coalition
and
the
security
forces
are
dominated
by
the
Tigray
ethnic
group
,
which
makes
up
only
about
6
percent
of
the
population
.
The
government
,
though
,
blames
rebel
groups
and
foreign-based
dissidents
for
stoking
the
violence
.

Aid
officials
say
international

have
been

by
crises
in
Syria
and
other
parts
of
the
world
AYDORA
,
ETHIOPIA
Ethiopia
is
in
the
grip
of
a
devastating
drought
sparked
by
the
worst
El
Niño
in
a
generation
,
and
aid
agencies
warn
that
food
aid
could
run
out
as
soon
as
May
.
Unlike
in
the
past
,
the
government
and
aid
groups
have
kept
food
shipments
flowing
to
areas
ravaged
by
drought
in
recent
months
.
But
they
need
more
money
,
at
a
time
when
international
donors
are
distracted
by
a
string
of
humanitarian
disasters
around
the
world
.
Above
:
In
the
various
pastoralist
regions
of
Ethiopia
,
the
livestock
are
often
the
first
affected
by
the
drought
because
of
the
lack
of
adequate
grazing
land
.
Ethiopia
burned
itself
into
the
West’s
collective
memory
with
the
horrific
famines
of
1973
and
1984
,
when
hundreds
of
thousands
starved
to
death
and
images
of
dying
children
appeared
on
the
world’s
television
screens
.
Since
that
time
,
the
government
has
struggled
to
shed
this
image
of
the
world’s
charity
case
by
turning
Ethiopia
into
Africa’s
new
economic
juggernaut
,
with
a
decade
of
10
percent
annual
growth
.
Barring
natural
disasters
,
the
country
is
also
practically
self-sufficient
in
food
.
Members
of
a
community
in
Chelko
,
Ethiopia
,
wait
to
receive
their
rationing
of
food
supplies
,
which
could
include
wheat
,
oil
and
split
peas
.
Due
to
food
shortages
,
rationing
and
distribution
can
often
be
based
on
a
regional
rotation
.
There
has
also
been
a
concerted
effort
in
cooperation
with
international
aid
agencies
to
create
safety
nets
to
ensure
that
the
kind
of
famine
that
inspired
the
1985
Live
Aid
concert
would
never
happen
again
.
These
days
,
early
warning
systems
alert
the
government
when
famine
threatens
,
and
in
2015
,
these
kicked
into
action
after
the
spring
and
summer
rains
failed
,
leaving
herders
trapped
in
desert
pastures
and
farmers
with
extensive
crop
failures
across
the
north
and
east
of
the
country
.
The
drought
is
caused
in
part
by
the
El
Niño
warming
phenomenon
over
the
Pacific
Ocean
,
a
cyclical
phenomenon
that
many
scientists
say
has
intensified
in
recent
years
because
of
global
climate
change
.
It
has
disrupted
rains
in
different
parts
of
the
continent
,
with
South
Africa
and
Zimbabwe
experiencing
drought
as
well
.
At
first
,
some
in
the
Ethiopian
government
claimed
the
country
could
handle
the
drought
itself
.
But
as
the
numbers
of
needy
skyrocketed
,
authorities
issued
an
appeal
.
In
December
,
they
said
about
10.2
million
people
were
in
need
of
$1.4
billion
in
aid
,
with
400,000
children
severely
malnourished
.
This
is
in
addition
to
8
million
people
supported
by
the
government
safety
net
even
before
the
drought
.
To
date
,
46
percent
of
the
appeal
has
been
met
,
and
the
worst
could
be
yet
to
come
.
Aside
from
fetching
firewood
for
cooking
,
women
are
also
responsible
for
fetching
water
for
drinking
and
cooking
.
With
limited
water
supply
,
women
dig
holes
across
the
bare
land
in
hopes
of
reaching
the
water
table
.
The
daily
chore
can
take
several
hours
and
often
yields
murky
water
.
“
I
remember
1984
,
people
would
migrate
or
just
die
,”
said
Mohammed
Abdullah
,
a
haggard
farmer
in
his
40s
in
a
village
in
the
highlands
of
East
Hararghe
,
about
300
miles
east
of
the
capital
.
Normally
,
villagers
would
be
harvesting
corn
and
sorghum
now
,
but
the
terraced
hillsides
were
largely
empty
.
“
This
time
,
the
government
response
is
on
time
and
coming
before
people
leave
.”
He
shuddered
,
though
,
when
asked
what
would
happen
if
the
handouts
stopped
,
as
may
happen
if
an
additional
$700
million
in
funding
is
not
secured
.
“
If
there
was
no
support
and
the
rains
don’t
come
,
people
will
start
dying
.”
Abdullah
said
that
although
the
food
aid
was
not
enough
,
the
villagers
were
surviving
by
sharing
what
they
received
.
“
Now
we
are
begging
for
rain
,”
said
Raimah
Sayyed
,
70
,
as
she
cuddled
her
half-naked
grandchild
and
absently
tore
leaves
off
a
nearby
bush
and
chewed
on
them
.
“
If
the
rain
comes
,
everything
will
be
okay
.”
Local
officials
say
that
the
need
is
actually
larger
than
the
handouts
and
,
in
some
cases
,
villagers
are
getting
the
food
rations
every
other
month
to
stretch
supplies
.

Mohammed

breakfast
for
her
2-year-old
at

in
Geramam
.
Many
in
the
small
community
survive
by
trading
what
they
have
,
while
others
buy
supplies
on
credit
or
sell
their
remaining
cattle
.
‘
All
we
need
are
the
resources
’
In
contrast
to
past
droughts
,
the
government
has
spent
heavily
of
its
own
money
to
stave
off
famine
,
putting
down
$381
million
since
the
summer
,
which
Mitiku
Kassa
,
the
head
of
the
Disaster
Prevention
and
Preparedness
Committee
,
points
out
was
practically
the
entire
government
budget
20
years
ago
.
It
is
not
enough
,
however
,
and
in
January
,
a
roundtable
with
the
United
Nations
,
the
U.S
.
Agency
for
International
Development
and
other
donors
was
held
to
call
for
more
funds
.
Aid
agencies
have
singled
out
the
United
States
as
the
most
responsive
country
,
with
$532
million
spent
on
humanitarian
aid
since
October
2014
,
including
$97
million
in
aid
announced
in
January
.
Kassa
said
there
are
signs
the
world
is
waking
up
to
the
severity
of
the
situation
.
“
It
was
so
slow
because
of
the
prior
engagement
of
the
donor
partners
,
especially
in
the
Middle
East
with
the
Syrian
immigrants
to
Europe
,”
he
said
,
adding
that
“
the
scale
of
the
drought
is
far
bigger
than
the
drought
we
confronted
in
1984
.”
John
Graham
,
the
country
director
of
Save
the
Children
for
Ethiopia
and
a
19-year
veteran
of
aid
work
in
the
country
,
said
this
is
the
worst
international
response
to
a
drought
that
he
has
seen
.
“
We
have
got
a
really
,
really
bad
drought
,
but
we
can
head
off
the
consequences
.
All
we
need
are
the
resources
,”
he
said
.
“
We
don’t
have
to
wait
six
months
from
now
to
see
hungry
babies
on
television
screens
.”
The
suffering
may
be
evident
sooner
than
that
,
according
to
the
World
Food
Program
(
WFP
),
one
of
the
major
providers
of
the
food
rations
being
handed
out
to
patiently
waiting
people
at
centers
across
the
country
.
The
agency
estimates
that
unless
new
money
comes
in
by
the
end
of
February
,
those
centers
will
stop
providing
the
monthly
ration
by
May
,
and
at
that
point
the
real
disaster
will
occur
.
“
Because
in
May
,
if
we
run
out
of
food
,
we
start
having
a
pretty
immediate
spike
in
severe
malnutrition
,”
said
John
Aylieff
,
WFP
country
director
,
referring
to
the
swollen
bellies
and
listless
children
long
associated
with
droughts
.
“
We
have
a
chance
to
stop
this
—
we
have
a
chance
to
keep
Ethiopia
on
its
development
trajectory
—
but
the
window
we
have
to
work
with
is
very
small
.”
“
There
was
no
rain
,
no
pastures
.
The
ground
became
like
sand
,”
recalled
Asha
Abdelahi
at
the
Aydora
camp
in
the
middle
of
a
flat
,
scrub-filled
desert
,
describing
how
her
herd
of
200
sheep
and
goats
has
been
reduced
to
just
five
.
“
The
animals
started
dying
,
so
I
carried
my
children
here
.”
“
Here
”
is
a
collection
of
small
buildings
,
a
children’s
clinic
and
a
school
under
a
grove
of
acacia
trees
more
than
60
miles
from
the
nearest
city
.
It
is
home
to
more
than
8,000
people
.
An
estimated
100,000
people
have
been
displaced
by
the
drought
since
the
summer
.
For
now
,
the
children
are
filled
with
energy
,
badgering
visiting
reporters
before
getting
shooed
away
by
stick-wielding
elders
.
But
it
is
a
precarious
life
,
and
should
the
trucks
carrying
the
sacks
of
grain
be
interrupted
,
it
could
rapidly
deteriorate
.
Each
morning
,
Meskey
Mohammed
,
25
,
herds
her
goats
up
a
rugged
mountain
within
walking
distance
of
her
home
in
Geramam
.
Since
the
drought
began
,
she
has
lost
15
goats
and
is
surviving
through
her
husband
,
who
is
working
as
a
laborer
in
a
nearby
town
.
A
recipient
of
the
Mercy
Corps
voucher
program
,
she
is
able
to
keep
her
cattle
alive
due
to
the
proximity
of
the
remaining
grazing
land
in
her
area
.

Situation
Overview
and
Humanitarian
Needs
The
El
Niño
global
climactic
event
has
wreaked
havoc
on
Ethiopia’s
summer
rains
(
June
to
September
).
Following
a
rapid
assessment
in
early
October
,
the
Government
and
partners
concluded
that
the
number
of
people
requiring
emergency
food
assistance
had
increased
to
8.2
million
compared
to
an
estimated
2.9
million
at
the
beginning
of
the
year1
.
The
deteriorating
food
security
situation
has
contributed
to
increased
malnutrition
among
children
with
an
estimated
350,000
children
requiring
life-saving
therapeutic
treatment
in
2015
–
a
25
per
cent
increase
compared
to
2014
.
There
are
fears
that
this
figure
will
continue
to
grow
;
efforts
are
currently
underway
to
further
identify
the
most
urgent
needs
for
the
coming
year
.
Due
to
a
massive
national
level
screenings
conducted
in
August
the
admissions
for
September
were
relatively
lower
than
in
August
.
In
detail
,
the
national
levels
of
Severe
Acute
Malnutrition
(
SAM
)
admissions
for
September
are
20
per
cent
higher
than
any
other
year
recorded
for
the
same
month
.
It
is
believed
that
the
SAM
cases
will
continue
to
rise
as
most
of
the
country
is
Meher
rain
dependent
,
which
has
already
failed
.
Likewise
,
with
a
current
cumulative
amount
of
257,561
admissions
,
the
current
trend
indicates
that
2015
will
record
the
highest
total
admissions
from
the
past
years
.
In
September
,
Amhara
Region
recorded
the
highest
monthly
SAM
admissions
(
6,489
children
)
as
compared
to
past
years
.
The
nutrition
situation
in
Amhara
,
much
like
other
at-risk
areas
in
Ethiopia
,
is
driven
by
deteriorating
household
food
security
due
to
the
failed
Belg
harvest
,
delayed
early
mature
Meher
crop
production
and
delayed
response
of
target
supplementary
feeding
to
address
moderate
malnutrition
.
Furthermore
,
Amhara
is
experiencing
high
levels
of
scabies
among
children
in
the
region
.
The
effects
of
the
drought
are
expected
to
extend
through
2016
.
In
most
of
the
affected
areas
,
the
next
rains
are
only
expected
in
February/March
2016
,
and
much
will
depend
on
the
performance
of
these
seasonal
rains
.
The
humanitarian
situation
is
hence
expected
to
deteriorate
.
In
October
,
floods
killed
two
women
and
three
children
in
Mustahil
,
Kelafo
and
East
Imey
woredas
in
Shaballe
Zone
of
Somali
Region
.
The
floods
displaced
more
than
46,500
people
,
affected
some
102,000
others
and
killed
some
10,000
livestock
.
Access
to
affected
areas
is
limited
as
roads
are
cut
off
.
Eight
schools
and
19
alternative
basic
education
centers
in
Kelafo
and
Mustahil
woredas
are
closed
,
leaving
some
7,500
children
out
of
school
.
Health
facilities
are
affected
by
the
floods
while
there
is
severe
infestation
from
mosquitoes
and
increased
threat
of
malaria
outbreak
.
Whilst
many
water
points
are
filled
by
mud
,
21
hand
dug
wells
have
been
destroyed
.
People
are
collecting
water
from
unprotected
sources
with
high
risk
of
contamination
for
water
borne
diseases
.
Most
of
the
farm
land
in
the
areas
are
flooded
and
crops
have
been
destroyed
.
A
multi-agency
team
,
including
the
regional
disaster
prevention
and
preparedness
bureau
,
the
regional
health
and
education
bureaus
,
Save
the
Children
International
,
UNICEF
,
WFP
and
local
NGOs
(
ARDA
OWDA
,
,
SOA
),
was
deployed
in
the
area
from
27
to
31
of
October
.
The
team
recommends
urgent
provision
of
food
,
non-food
items
(
shelter
,
kitchen
utensils
sleeping
mats
,
blankets
),
mosquito
nets
,
water
purification
chemicals
and
provision
of
essential
drugs
.
As
of
October
2015
,
Gambella
is
hosting
some
277,732
South
Sudanese
refugees
,
living
within
the
host
communities
(
16
per
cent
)
and
in
refugee
camps
(
84
per

).
Out
of
these
,
220,108
refugees
have
arrived
since
December
2013
.
The
arrival
rate
has
decreased
to
10
persons
per
day
compared
to
90
at
the
beginning
of
September
2015
.
In
2015
,
in
total
28,723
South
Sudanese
refugees
have
arrived
in
Ethiopia
while
191,385
have
arrived
in
2014
.
A
total
of
five
suspected
cases
of
meningitis
have
been
reported
among
South
Sudanese
refugees
in
Gambella
,
with
three
cases
confirmed
.
No
case
has
been
identified
since
30
October
.
The
Ministry
of
Health
has
recommended
mass
vaccination
campaign
.
A
population
of
500,000
people
is
targeted
by
the
campaign
,
which
includes
an
estimated
277,000
refugees
aged
between
2
and
30
years
in
all
camps
as
well
as
the
surrounding

The
Eritrean
government
imposes
public
transports
ban
to
and
from
Gash
Barka
region
where
thousands
of
latest
Ethiopian
refugees
are
located
to
prevent
the
spread
of
cholera
.
So
far
,
22
outbreaks
of
cholera
disease
are
reported
in
the
region
for
the
first
time
inside
the
country
,
and
the
government
has
created
a
system
of
measures
to
assist
Ethiopians
who
are
fleeing
the
recent
protest
against
the
Tigray
People’s
Liberation
Front
(
TPLF
)
at
the
border
points
.
Sources
inside
the
Ethiopian
Ministry
of
Health
,
and
Amhara
and
Oromia
regional
health
bureaus
about
the
intentional
spread
of
the
Vibrio
cholera
bacterium
by
the
current
Ethnic
minority
Tigrayan
dominated
regime
as
a
tactic
and
method
to
undermine
the
current
Amhara
and
Oromo
people
protests
.
The
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
also
said
that
the
health
and
medical
professionals
in
Ethiopia
are
not
allowed
to
provide
cholera-related
health
education
and
promotion
activities
.
In
the
Amhara
regional
capital
city
of
Bahir
Dar
,
the
center
of
Amhara
people
protests
,
more
than
1200
cholera
cases
and
60
cholera
related
deaths
are
reported
.
TPLF
is
trying
to
deceive
and
misinform
the
people
by
changing
the
medical
term
for
this
deadly
and
highly
contagious
cholera
disease
into
the
so-called
”
Acute
Watery
Diarrhoea
(
AWD
)”.
Also
,
health
professionals
are
not
allowed
to
publicly
speak
about
the
magnitude
and
severity
of
this
cholera
outbreak
in
Ethiopia
.
The
TPLF
regime
is
known
for
using
humanitarian
food
and
medical
aid
for
military
and
political
purposes
.
Human
Right
Watch
report
,
entitled
“
Development
without
Freedom
How
Aid
Underwrites
Repression
in
Ethiopia
”
documented
that
the
ruling
Tigray
People
Liberation
Front
has
used
donor-supported
humanitarian
emergency
programs
as
political
weapons
to
control
the
population
,
punish
dissent
,
and
undermine
political
opponents
.
Dr
Aregawi
Berhe
and
Mr
Gebremedhen
Araya
,
who
were
senior
TPLF
commanders
,
witnessed
that
the
current
ruling
party
(
TPLF/EPRDF
)
was
used
Millions
of
dollar
of
Western
aid
money
to
buy
weapons
which
were
intended
to
buy
food
and
medicine
for
starving
Ethiopians
during
the
country’s
infamous
1984
famine
.
Recently
declassified
document
from
the
CIA
by
WikiLeaks
support
these
claims
.
“
Some
funds
that
insurgent
organizations
are
raising
for
relief
operations
,
as
a
result
of
increased
world
publicity
,
are
almost
certainly
being
diverted
for
military
purposes
,”
the
Agency
wrote
in
a
report
.
