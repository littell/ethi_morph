Each folder in this directory is a different version of the morphology parser for Oromo.

Within each folder, there are two different parsers. The first, called orm_morph.py, is for morphological parsing of standard Oromo text. The second, called orm_morph_norm.py, is for morphological parsing of Oromo text that has been normalized (e.g., by making all vowels short), to account for spelling variations.

For both files, they should be used by importing the desired file as a library and calling the function parse(string, channel_name), where string is a string to be parsed and channel_name describes the desired type of output: "gloss" for the gloss, "breakdown" for a morphological breakdown, "lemma" for the lemma, "natural" for a more natural-sounding gloss.
